<span class="smaller">THE EXPEDITION</span></h2>
</div>



<p><span class="smcap">Men</span> go out into the void spaces of the world for various
reasons. Some are incited simply by a love of adventure,
some have a keen thirst for scientific knowledge,
and others are drawn away from trodden paths by the
mysterious fascination of the unknown. I think that
in my own case it was a combination of these factors
that determined me to try my fortune once again in
the frozen south.</p>

<p>I had been invalided home before the conclusion of the
<i>Discovery</i> expedition, and I had the keenest desire to
see more of the vast continent that lies amid the
Antarctic snows and glaciers. Indeed the stark polar
lands grip the hearts of men who have lived on them
in a manner that can hardly be understood by people
who have never got outside the pale of civilisation. I
was convinced, moreover, that an expedition on the
lines I had in view could justify itself by the results of
its scientific work.</p>

<p>The <i>Discovery</i> expedition had performed splendid
service in several important branches of science, and
I believed that a second expedition could carry the work
still further. For instance, the southern limits of the
Great Ice Barrier had not been defined, and it was
important to the scientific world that information should
be gained regarding the movement of the ice-sheet that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">- 12 -</span>
forms the barrier. I also wanted to discover what lay
beyond the mountains to the south of latitude 82Â° 17â€²
and whether the Antarctic continent rose to a plateau
similar to the one found by Captain Scott beyond the
western mountains.</p>

<p>There was much also to be done in the fields of
meteorology, zoology, biology, mineralogy and general
geology, so much in fact that apart from the wish to
gain a higher latitude the expedition seemed to be
justified on scientific grounds alone.</p>

<p>The difficulty that confronts most men who wish to
undertake exploration work is that of finance, and
for some time I was faced by financial problems; but
when the governments of Australia and New Zealand
came to my assistance, the position became more satisfactory.</p>

<p>In the <i>Geographical Journal</i> for March 1907, I outlined
my plan of campaign, but this had materially to be
changed later on owing to circumstances. "The shore-party
of nine or twelve men will winter with sufficient
equipment to enable three separate parties to start out
in the spring," I announced. "One party will go east,
and, if possible, across the Barrier to the new land
known as King Edward VII Land, the second party
will proceed south over the same route as that of the
southern sledge-party of the <i>Discovery</i>, the third party
will possibly proceed westward over the mountains, and,
instead of crossing in a line due west, will strike towards
the magnetic pole. The main changes in equipment
will be that Siberian ponies will be taken for the sledge
journeys both east and south, and also a specially
designed motor-car for the southern journey. I do not
intend to sacrifice the scientific utility of the expedition
to a mere record-breaking journey, but say frankly, all
the same, that one of my great efforts will be to reach
the southern geographical pole."</p>

<p>My intention was that the expedition should leave
New Zealand at the beginning of 1908, and proceed to
winter quarters on the Antarctic continent, the ship
to land men and stores and then return. By avoiding
the ship being frozen in, the use of a relief ship would
be unnecessary, as the same vessel could come south
again the following summer and take us off.</p>

<p>Before we finally left England I had decided that if
possible I would establish my base on King Edward VII
Land instead of at the <i>Discovery</i> winter quarters in
McMurdo Sound, so that we might break entirely new
ground. The narrative will show how, as far as this
particular matter was concerned, my plans were upset
by the demands of the situation. Owing largely to
the unexpected loss of ponies before the winter, the
journey to King Edward VII Land over the Barrier was
not attempted.</p>

<p>As the expedition was entirely my own venture I
decided that I would have no committee, and thus I
avoided delays that are inevitable when a group of men
have to arrive at a decision on points of detail. The aim
of one who undertakes to organise such an expedition
must be to provide for every contingency, and in dealing
with this Work I was fortunate enough to secure the
assistance of Mr. Alfred Reid, who had already gained
considerable experience in connection with previous
polar ventures, and whoâ€”as manager of the expeditionâ€”was
invaluable to me.</p>

<span class="smaller">Iâ€”SUPPLIES</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a polar expedition the food must in the first place
be wholesome and nourishing in the highest possible
degree. Scurvyâ€”that dread diseaseâ€”was once regarded
as the inevitable result of a prolonged stay in ice-bound
regions, but by selecting food-stuffs which had been
prepared on scientific lines we entirely avoided any
sickness attributable directly or indirectly to the foods
we took with us.</p>

<p>In the second place the food taken on the sledging
expeditions must be as light as possible, always remembering
that in very low temperatures the heat of
the body can be maintained only by use of fatty and
farinaceous foods in fairly large quantities. The sledging-foods
must also be such as do not require prolonged
cooking, for the amount of fuel that can be carried is
limited. It must even be possible to eat these foods
without any cooking, because the fuel may be lost or
exhausted.</p>

<p>As regards foods for use at the winter quarters of the
expedition a greater variety was possible, for the ship
might be expected to reach that point and weight was
consequently of less importance. My aim was to get
a large variety of foods for the winter night, when the
long months of darkness severely strain men unaccustomed
to the conditions.</p>

<p>I based my estimates on the requirements of twelve
men for two years, but this was added to in New Zealand
when the staff was increased.</p>

<p>At first the question of packing presented difficulties,
but at last I decided to use "Venesta" cases both for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">- 16 -</span>
food-stuffs and as much as possible for equipment.
These cases are manufactured from composite boards
prepared by uniting three layers of birch or other hard
wood with water-proof cement. They were eminently
suited to our purpose, and the saving of weight, as
compared with an ordinary packing-case, was about
four pounds per case. In spite of the rough handling
our stores received in the process of being landed at
Cape Royds, after the expedition had reached the
Antarctic we had no trouble with breakages.</p>


<p class="caption2">IIâ€”EQUIPMENT</p>

<p>After placing orders for the principal food supplies
I went to Norway with Mr. Reid to secure sledges, fur
boots and mits, sleeping bags, ski, &amp;c. The sledges
were to be of the Nansen pattern, built of specially
selected timber and of the best workmanship. I ordered
ten twelve-foot sledges, eighteen eleven-foot sledges and
two seven-foot sledges, the largest being suitable for
pony-haulage. The sledges were made by Messrs. Hagen
and Company of Christiania and proved to be all that
I desired.</p>

<p>The next step was to secure furs, but this was not
a very large order as after the experience of the <i>Discovery</i>
expedition I decided to use fur only for the feet and
hands and for the sleeping-bags, relying otherwise on
woollen garments with an outer covering of windproof
material. I ordered three large sleeping-bags, to hold
three men each, and twelve one-man bags. Each bag
had the reindeer fur inside, and the seams were covered
with leather strongly sewn.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">- 18 -</span></p>

<p>The foot-gear I ordered consisted of eighty pairs of
ordinary finnesko or reindeer-fur boots, twelve pairs of
special finnesko and sixty pairs of ski boots of various
sizes. The ordinary finnesko is made from the skin of
the reindeer stag's head, with the fur outside, and its shape
is roughly that of a very large boot without any laces.
It is large enough to hold the foot, several pairs of socks,
and a supply of sennegrass, and it is a wonderfully warm
and comfortable foot-gear. This sennegrass is a dried
grass of long fibre with a special quality of absorbing
moisture and I bought fifty kilos (110.25 lb.) of it in
Norway.</p>

<p>The sixty pairs of wolfskin and dogskin mits which I
ordered from Mr. MÃ¶ller were made with the fur outside,
were long enough to protect the wrists, and had one
compartment for the four fingers and another for the
thumb. They were worn over woollen gloves and were
hung round the neck with lamp-wick when the use of
the fingers was required.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">THE SHIP, THE HUT AND OTHER NECESSITIES</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> I left Norway I visited Sandyfjord to see whether
I could come to terms with Mr. C. Christiansen, the
owner of the <i>Bjorn</i>, a ship specially built for polar work;
but much as I wished to try her I could not afford to pay
the price.</p>

<p>So when I returned to London I purchased the <i>Nimrod</i>.
She was small and old, and her maximum speed under
steam was hardly more than six knots, but on the other
hand she was able to face rough treatment in the ice. I
confess that I was disappointed when I first examined
the little ship, to which I was about to commit the hopes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">- 19 -</span>
and aspirations of many years, but I had not then become
acquainted with her many good qualities, and my first
impression scarcely did justice to the plucky old ship.
She was at once put into the hands of Messrs. R. &amp; H.
Green of Blackwall, the famous firm that had built
so many of Britain's "wooden walls," and that had
done fitting and repairing work for several other polar
expeditions, and day by day she assumed a more
satisfactory appearance. Quarters were provided for
the scientific staff of the expedition by enclosing a portion
of the after-hold and constructing cabins which were
entered by a steep ladder from the deck-house. For
some reason not on record these small quarters were
known later as "Oyster Alley."</p>

<p>As however the <i>Nimrod</i>, after landing the shore-party
with stores and equipment, would return to New Zealand,
it was necessary that we should have a reliable hut in
which to live during the Antarctic night, and until the
sledging journeys began in the following spring.</p>


<p class="caption2">THE HUT</p>

<p>I ordered a hut (which was to be our only refuge from
furious blizzards) measuring externally 33 ft. by 19 ft. by
8 ft. to the eaves from Messrs. Humphreys of Knightsbridge.
It was specially constructed to my order, and
after being erected and inspected in London was shipped
in sections.</p>

<p>It was made of stout fir timbering of best quality in
walls, roofs and floors, and the parts were all morticed
and tenoned to make erection easy in the Antarctic.
Great precautions were taken against the extreme cold,
and the hut was to be erected on wooden piles let into the
ground or ice, and rings were fixed to the top of the roof<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">- 20 -</span>
so that guy-ropes might be used to give additional
resistance to the gales. The hut had two doors, connected
by a small porch, so that ingress or egress would
not cause a draught of cold air, and the windows were
double so that the warmth of the hut might be retained.
We took little furniture as I proposed to use cases for
the construction of benches, beds, and other necessary
articles of internal equipment. The hut was to be
lighted with acetylene gas, and we took a generator, the
necessary piping and a supply of carbide.</p>

<p>We also took a cooking-range, manufactured by
Messrs. Smith and Wellstrood, of London, which had
a fire chamber designed to burn anthracite coal continuously
day and night.</p>


<p class="caption2">CLOTHING</p>

<p>Each member of the expedition was supplied with
two winter suits made of heavy blue pilot cloth, lined
with Jaeger fleece. An outer suit of windproof material
is necessary in the polar regions, and I secured twenty-four
suits of Burberry gabardine. The underclothing was
obtained from the Dr. Jaeger Sanitary Woollen Company.</p>


<p class="caption2">PONIES, DOGS, AND MOTOR-CAR</p>

<p>I decided to take ponies, dogs, and a car to assist in
hauling our sledges on long journeys, but my hopes
were mainly based on the ponies. Dogs had not proved
satisfactory on the Barrier surface, but I was sure that
the hardy ponies used in Northern China and Manchuria
would be useful if landed in good condition on the ice.
They had done good work both on the Jackson-Harmsworth
expedition and in the Russo-Japanese War.
Fifteen of these ponies, practically unbroken and about
fourteen hands high, were selected and ultimately transferred
to Quail Island in Port Lyttelton, where they were
free to feed in luxury until they were required.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">- 22 -</span></p>

<p>As I thought it possible, from my previous experience,
that we might find a hard surface on the Great Ice
Barrier, I resolved to take a motor-car, so I selected
a 12-15 horse-power New Arrol-Johnston car, fitted
with a specially designed air-cooled four-cylinder engine
and Simms Bosch magneto ignition. A non-freezing
oil was prepared for me by Messrs. Price and Company.
I placed, as I have suggested, but small reliance on dogs;
I did however order forty of the descendants of the
Siberian dogs used on the Newnes-Borchgrevink expedition.
The breeder was only able to let me have nine,
but this team proved sufficient for my purposes.</p>


<p class="caption2">SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS</p>

<p>On the scientific side the equipment of a polar expedition
is very costly, and I felt the pinch of necessary
economies in this branch. I was, however, greatly
assisted by loans of instruments and charts from the
Admiralty; the Royal Geographical Society lent me
three chronometer watches, and three wardens of the
Skinners' Company gave me one chronometer watch
which accompanied me on my journey to the Pole and
which proved to be the most accurate of all. We also
took with us a photographic equipment which included
nine cameras, and a cinematograph machine in order that
we might place on record the curious movements of seals
and penguins.</p>

<p>For the rest I had tried to provide for every contingency,
and the gear ranged from needles and nails to a Remington
typewriter and two Singer sewing machines. There was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">- 23 -</span>
also a gramophone and a complete printing-press; and
even hockey-sticks and a football were not forgotten.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was no easy matter for me to select the staff from the
large number (over 400) of applicants who wished to join

<p>After much consideration I selected eleven men for the

Joyceâ€”had been known to me previously, while only
Wild and Joyce, having been members of the <i>Discovery</i>
expedition, had previous experience of polar work.

this was also the case with the officers whom I chose for
the <i>Nimrod</i>. Before leaving New Zealand I was able

came on board and inspected the ship, an honour which
was greatly appreciated by the members of the expedition.
Her Majesty graciously entrusted me with a Union Jack
to be carried on the southern journey, and His Majesty
graciously conferred on me the Victorian Order.</p>

<p>On Wednesday August 7, the ship sailed for New
Zealand, and arrived at Lytteltonâ€”from whence the
final departure for the south was to be madeâ€”on
November 23. Mr. Reid reached Australian waters a
month ahead of the <i>Nimrod</i>, so that he might make
necessary arrangements and meet the Manchurian ponies.</p>

<span class="smaller">WE LEAVE LYTTELTON</span></h2>
</div>


<p>By strenuous labour we were in readiness to start from
Lyttelton on New Year's Day, and we were honoured
by the Postmaster-General of the Dominion printing off
for us a small issue of special stamps, and making me
a postmaster during my stay in the Antarctic.</p>

<p>The quarters of the scientific staff on board the <i>Nimrod</i>
were certainly small, and as the day of departure
approached, Oyster Alley reached a state of congestion
awful to contemplate. The poniesâ€”of which we finally
took away ten known as "Socks," "Queen," "Grisi,"
"Chinaman," "Billy," "Zulu," "Doctor," "Sandy,"
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">- 27 -</span>
"Nimrod," and "Mac"â€”were carried on deck and ten
stout stalls were built for them. The motor-car was
enclosed in a large case and made fast with chains on the
after-hatch whence it could be transferred easily to the
ice. Our deck load, indeed, was so heavy that the
<i>Nimrod</i> was low in the water, and when we left Lyttelton
the little ship had only three feet six inches of freeboard.</p>

<p>In order to save coal I was anxious to have the <i>Nimrod</i>
towed south, and the Government of the Dominion agreed
to pay half the cost of the tow, and Sir James Mills,
chairman of the Union Steamship Company, offered to
pay the other half. The <i>Koonya</i>, a steel-built steamer
of about 1100 tons, was chartered and placed under the
command of Captain F. P. Evans. The wisdom of this
selection was proved by subsequent events. Before my
departure I placed the conduct of the affairs of the
expedition in New Zealand into the hands of Mr. J. J.
Kinsey, whose assistance and advice had already been
of great service to me.</p>

<p>January 1, 1908, arrived at last, a warm and clear
morning for our last day in civilisation. Before sunset
we were to sever all ties with the outer world, but we all
looked forward eagerly to our coming venture, for the
glamour of the unknown was with us and the south was
calling.</p>

<p>All day long the deck of our little vessel was thronged
by sight-seers, who showed the greatest interest in everything
connected with the ship and her equipment. There
were many whose criticisms were frankly pessimistic as
to our chances of weathering an Antarctic gale, for the
<i>Nimrod</i> was deep in the water, but we, having confidence
in the ship, were not disturbed by these criticisms.</p>

<p>Oyster Alley was crammed with the personal belongings
of at least fourteen of the shore-party, and if you once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">- 28 -</span>
got into it the difficulty of getting out was even greater.
The entrance to this twentieth-century Black Hole was
through a narrow doorway and down a ladder, which
ushered one into almost complete darkness. And it was
in this uncomfortable, crowded, murky place that the
spirit of romance grew strong in the heart of George
Buckley, until he suddenly jumped up and asked if I
would take him as far as the ice. I was only too glad to
consent, for his interest in the expedition showed that
his heart was in the right place, and his personality had
already appealed to us all. It was then 2 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> and the
<i>Nimrod</i> sailed at 4 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, but in those two hours he dashed
to Christchurch, gave his power of attorney to a friend,
slung a tooth-brush and some underclothing into a bag,
and arrived on board a few minutes before sailing time,
equipped for the most rigorous weather in the world with
only the summer suit he was wearing. Surely a record in
the way of joining a polar expedition!</p>

<p>Cheer after cheer broke from the watching thousands
as we moved towards the harbour entrance, and after
a most cordial send-off we stopped to pick up our tow-line
from the <i>Koonya</i>; and this operation being completed
we signalled the <i>Koonya</i> to go ahead and were soon
in the open sea.</p>

<p>Fortunately we did not know that we were not to take
our clothes off for the next two weeks, and that we were to
live in a constant state of wetness and watchfulness until
we arrived in the neighbourhood of winter quarters.
But bad weather was not long delayed, and I was soon
wishing for the splendid modern gear of the <i>Discovery</i>,
the large, specially built vessel that we had on the
previous expedition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">- 30 -</span></p>

<p>As the wind and sea increased the <i>Nimrod</i> pitched about,
shifting everything that could be moved on deck. The
seas began to break over her, and we were soon wet
through, not to be properly dry again for many days.
Our chief anxiety was the care of the ponies, and looking
back now to those days, it remains wonderful to me how
they survived the hardships that fell to their lot.</p>

<p>The <i>Nimrod</i> hadâ€”owing to her deeply loaded conditionâ€”begun
the voyage like a reluctant child being dragged
to school, but as the gale increased in vehemence she
seemed to throw off the sluggishness which possessed
her, when she had found herself outward bound at the
end of a tow-line for the first time in her strenuous life
of forty years. Now that the tow-line was but little useâ€”save
to steady us in the furious galeâ€”the <i>Nimrod</i>
began to play her own hand, and marvellously well did
she play it. So furiously did the gale blow that on the
morning of the 5th I told Captain England to signal and
ask the <i>Koonya</i> to pour oil on the water, but although
this helped us to a certain extent it did not prevent the
heaviest seas from breaking on board. The <i>Nimrod</i>
rolled over fifty degrees from the perpendicular to each
side; how much more than that I cannot say for the
indicator was only marked up to fifty degrees, and the
pointer had passed that mark. Under these circumstances
it was but natural that the sturdy ponies had their
strength taxed to the utmost to keep their footing. It
was impossible to sling them, for they were only half-broken,
and an attempt to put a sling under one nearly
drove it crazy with fright. On the night of the 5th
during an extra heavy roll one of the ponies slipped, and
when the ship rolled the opposite way it turned right over
on its back and could not regain its footing. All our
attempts to get "Doctor," as he was called, upon his
legs failed, and regretfully I had to order him to be shot.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE ANTARCTIC CIRCLE</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The continuous bad weather was attributed by some on
board to the fact that we had captured an albatross on
the second day out. It is generally supposed by seamen
to be unlucky to kill this bird, but as we did it for the
purposes of scientific collections and not with the wantonness
of the "Ancient Mariner," the superstitious must
seek another reason for the bad weather.</p>

<p>The storm increased until, by midnight on the 6th,
the squalls were of hurricane force, and the morning of
the 7th brought no relief. Seas came on board with more
frequency than ever, finding out any odd article that had
escaped our vigilance. At one time a sack of potatoes
was washed on to the deck and the contents were floating
in two or three feet of water, but standing on the poop
I heard one of the crew, in no way disheartened, singing,
as he gathered them up, "Here we go gathering nuts in
May."</p>

<p>On the evening of January 8, the gale was so terrific that
we had to signal to the <i>Koonya</i> to heave to. We did
this with the sea on our starboard quarter, and one
enormous wave smashed in part of the starboard bulwarks
and did muchâ€”though happily no vitalâ€”damage.
The galley was washed out and the fire extinguished, but
so pluckily did the members of the cooking department
work that never during this most uncomfortable time
were we without a warm meal. This was really a great
feat considering that the galley was only five feet square,
and thirty-nine persons blessed with very hearty appetites
had to be provided for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">- 32 -</span></p>

<p>To show what a state we were in I may mention that
in the wardroom I salved a small wooden case from the
water, and found that it contained a patent mixture for
extinguishing fires!</p>

<p>At noon on January 11 we were in latitude 57Â° 38â€²
South, and longitude 178Â° 39â€² West, but the weather,
which had moderated for a day or two, again became as
bad as ever. We had imagined that we might find
difficulty in cleaning out the stables, but the herculean
waves settled that difficulty in a most arbitrary and
thorough manner.</p>

<p>On the 13th we had a warmer and pleasanter day than
any we had experienced since leaving Lyttelton, and the
whole vessel began to look like a veritable Petticoat Lane.
Pyjamas and pillows of pulp that had once been pillows
of feathers, books and boots, coats and carpet-slippers
were lying in a mass on the poop deck so that they might
dry. A few of us ventured on baths, but in the open
air and with the temperature only two degrees above
freezing-point it was chilly work.</p>

<p>We were now keeping a sharp look-out for icebergs
and pack, and the meeting with the pack-ice was to
terminate the <i>Koonya's</i> tow; and that meant parting
with Buckley, who had endeared himself to every one on
board, and who had been of the greatest assistance in
the matter of the ponies.</p>

<p>Next morning, January 14, we sighted our first iceberg.
It had all the usual characteristics of the Antarctic bergs,
being practically tabular in form, and its sides being of
a dead white colour. During the afternoon we passed
two more icebergs with their usual tails of brash ice floating
out to leeward. The sea had changed colour from a
leaden blue to a greenish-grey, albatrosses were not
nearly so numerous, and the temperature of the air and
water had dropped to 32Â° Fahr. Everything pointed
to our nearness to the pack, and on the next morning
we saw the ice looming up through the mist to the
southward.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">- 34 -</span></p>

<p>Now had come the time for the <i>Koonya</i> to drop us, after
a tow of 1510 milesâ€”a record in towage for a vessel not
built for the purposeâ€”and before the <i>Koonya</i> finally
cast off from us, she had achieved another record by
being the first steel vessel to cross the Antarctic Circle.</p>

<p>About 10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> I decided to send Captain England across
to the <i>Koonya</i> with Buckley and the mail, our letters
being stamped with the special stamp given by the New
Zealand Government. As the sea was rising again we
lost no time in making the necessary communication
by boat between the two ships, and during a favourable
roll the whale-boat was dropped into the water, and
Buckleyâ€”with his week-end handbagâ€”jumped into her.
About a quarter to one Captain Evans signalled that
he was going to cut his hawser, for in the rising sea the
two vessels were in dangerous proximity to each other.</p>

<p>We saw the axe rise and fall, rise and fall again, and the
tie was severed. The <i>Koonya's</i> work was done, and at
last the <i>Nimrod</i> was dependent upon her own resources.
Our consort steamed round us, all hands on both ships
cheering; then her bows were set north and she vanished
into a grey, snowy mist, homeward bound. All that
afternoon we unremittingly toiled to get in the cable
link by link, and by seven o'clock we were able to proceed
and to put the ship's head due south.</p>

<p>By 2 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on January 16, the bergs were much more
numerous, but none of the ice we passed through at this
time had the slightest resemblance to pack-ice. An hour
later we entered an area of tabular bergs, varying from
80 to 150 ft. in height, and all the morning we steamed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">- 35 -</span>
in beautiful weather through the lanes and streets of a
wonderful snowy Venice. The magic of such a scene
cannot be described. As far as the eye could see, great,
white, wall-sided bergs stretched east, west and south,
contrasting strikingly with the lanes of blue-black water
between them.</p>

<p>A stillness, weird and uncanny, had fallen upon everything.
Here there was no sign of life, except when one
of the little snow petrels, invisible when flying across the
glistening bergs, flashed for a moment into sight. Beautiful
as this scene was it gave me some anxiety, for I knew
that if we were caught in a breeze amidst this maze of
floating ice it would go hard with us. Already an ominous
dark cloud was sweeping down from the north, and I
was unfeignedly thankful when, in the afternoon, I saw
open water ahead. After a few more turnings and
twistings we entered the ice-free Ross Sea, this being
the first time a passage had been made into that sea
without the vessel being held up by pack-ice; and I
think our success was due to the fact that we were to the
eastward of the pack, which had separated from the
land and the Barrier, and had drifted to the north-west.
Indeed all my experience goes to prove that the easterly
route is the best.</p>

<p>Whence these bergs had come is open to conjecture,
but I am certain that this ice had not long left the parent
barrier or coast-line, for there was no sign of weathering
on the sides. Our latitude at noon on the 16th was
68Â° 6â€² South, and the longitude 179Â° 21â€² West.</p>

<p>Before we entered the actual line of bergs a couple of
seals, probably a crabeater and a Weddell seal, appeared
on the floe-ice, and a few Adelie penguins were also seen.
The quaint walk and insatiable curiosity of these birds
greatly amused us, and Marston, our artist, whose sense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">- 36 -</span>
of the ludicrous is very fully developed, was in ecstasies
at their genuine surprise and profound concern when
they saw the ship.</p>

<p>It was fortunate that we cleared the ice during that
afternoon, for shortly afterwards the wind increased,
and the weather thickened with falling snow.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE ATTEMPT TO REACH KING
EDWARD VII LAND</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> were now in the Ross Sea, and evidently had avoided
the main pack. Our position at noon (Jan. 17) was
70Â° 43â€² South latitude, and 178Â° 58â€² East longitude, and
we were steering a little more westerly so as to strike
the Barrier well to the east of Barrier Inlet, and also to
avoid the heavy pack that previous expeditions had
encountered to the east of meridian 160Â° West. The
snow had now become hard and dry, like sagoâ€”the true
Antarctic type, and numbers of Antarctic petrels circled
round and round the ship.</p>

<p>We were now revelling in the indescribable freshness
of the Antarctic that seems to permeate one's being, and
which must be responsible for that longing to go again
which assails each returned explorer from polar regions.
On the morning of the 23rd we saw some very large
icebergs, which were evidently great masses broken off
the Barrier, and we were keeping a sharp look-out for
the Barrier itself. The thermometer registered some
twelve degrees of frost, but the wind was so dry that we
scarcely felt the cold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">- 37 -</span></p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Flight of Antarctic Petrels</span></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">- 38 -</span></p>

<p>At 9.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on the 23rd a low straight line appeared
ahead of the ship. It was the Barrier. After half an
hour it disappeared, but by eleven o'clock the straight
line stretching east and west was in full view and we
rapidly approached it. I had hoped to make the Barrier
about the position of what we call the Western Bight,
and at noon we could see a point which was obviously
the eastern limit of the Western Bight. Soon afterwards
we were within a quarter of a mile of the ice-face, and
exclamations of wonder at the stupendous bulk of the
Barrier were drawn from those who had not seen it
before.</p>

<p>Looking at the Barrier from some little distance, one
would imagine it to be a perfectly even wall of ice; when
steaming along parallel with it, however, the impression
it gave was that of a series of points, each of which
looked as though it might be the horn of a bay. Then
when the ship came abeam of it, one would see that the
wall only receded for a few hundred yards, and afterwards
new points came into view as the ship moved on. The
weather continued fine and calm, and there was absolutely
no sign of the strong westerly current along the
Barrier which we had always encountered during the
voyage of the <i>Discovery</i>.</p>

<p>About midnight we suddenly came to the end of a very
high portion of the Barrier, and entered a wide shallow
bay which must have been the inlet where Borchgrevink
landed in 1900, but it had changed greatly since that
time. About half a mile down this bay we reached fast
ice. It was about half-past twelve at night, and the
southerly sun shone in our faces.</p>

<p>To the east rose a long snow slope which cut the
horizon at the height of about 300 ft. It had every
appearance of ice-covered land but we could not stop
to make certain, for the heavy ice lying to the northward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">- 39 -</span>
of us was setting down into the bay, and if we were not
to be beset it was necessary to get away at once.
All round us were numbers of great whales showing
their dorsal fins as they occasionally sounded, so we
named this playground for these monsters "The Bay of
Whales."</p>

<p>As it was impossible to work to the eastward, we
struck northwards through an open lead and came south
to the Barrier again about 2 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on the 24th. Then
we coasted eastward along the wall of ice, always looking
out for the inlet. The lashings had been taken off the
motor-car, and the tackle rigged to hoist it out directly
we got alongside the ice-foot, to which the <i>Discovery</i> had
been moored. For in Barrier Inlet we proposed to place
our winter quarters.</p>

<p>I had decided on this inlet because I knew that it was
practically the beginning of King Edward VII Land, and
that the actual bare land was within an easy sledge
journey of that place, and it also had the great advantage
of being some ninety miles nearer to the South Pole than
any other spot that could be reached with the ship. A
further important reason was that it would be an easy
matter for the ship on its return to reach this part of
the Barrier, whereas King Edward VII Land itself
might quite possibly be unattainable if the season was
adverse.</p>

<p>However the best-laid schemes often prove impracticable
in polar exploration, and within a few hours our
first plan was found impossible to fulfil, for the very
sufficient reason that the inlet had disappeared. Great
disappointment as this was to us, we were thankful that
the Barrier had broken away before we had made our camp
upon it. The thought of what might have happened
made me decide then and there that, under no circumstances,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">- 40 -</span>
would I winter on the Barrier, and that wherever
we landed we would secure a solid rock foundation for our
winter home.</p>

<p>We had two strings to our bow and I resolved to use
the second and push forward towards King Edward VII
Land. The ship was headed eastward, again keeping a
few hundred yards off the Barrier, for here the cliff was
overhung and a fall of ice would assuredly have been
disastrous to us. Soon, however, I saw that we could
not make much easting in this way, for by 10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on
the 24th we were close to the pack and found that it was
pressed hard against the Barrier edge; and, what was
worse, the whole of the northern pack and bergs at this
spot were drifting in towards the Barrier.</p>

<p>The seriousness of this situation can be realised by the
reader if he imagines that he is in a small boat right under
the vertical white cliffs of Dover; that detached cliffs
are moving in from seaward slowly but surely with
resistless power and force, and that it will only be a
question of perhaps an hour or two before the two
masses come into contact, and crush his tiny craft as
they meet.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to retrace our steps, and
by steaming hard and working in and out of the looser
floes, we just managed to pass the point with barely fifty
yards of open water to spare between the Barrier and the
pack.</p>

<p>I breathed more freely when we passed this zone of
Immediate danger, for there were two or three hundred
yards of clear water now between us and the pack, and
after skirting along the seaward edge we came to the
high cliff of ice at the westerly end, and passed safely out
of the bay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">- 42 -</span></p>

<p>We then continued to the westward until in the evening
the ship's head was put north and we gained a fairly open
sea. It is, however, remarkable how limited is one's
horizon at sea, for although there appeared to be open
water for an indefinite distance we were soon up against
rigid ice again. The fact is that low pack-ice is not visible
at any great distance, and that one cannot trust an
appearance of open water. All night long we tried to
penetrate to the east, practically doubling in our tracks
before we were able to pursue the direction we wished
to follow.</p>

<p>By noon on January 25 I found that any hopes I had
of a clear run were vain, and the prospect of reaching
King Edward VII Land grew remoter every ensuing hour.
Indeed it seemed impossible to reach the land, and the
shortness of coal, the leaky condition of the ship, and the
necessity of landing all our stores and putting up the hut
before the vessel left us, made the situation an extremely
anxious one. I had not expected to find Barrier Inlet
gone, and, at the same time, the way to King Edward VII
Land absolutely blocked by ice, though the latter condition
was not unusual.</p>

<p>I decided to continue to try and make a way to the
east for at least another twenty-four hours, but when we
saw the western pack moving rapidly towards us under
the influence of the wind, and that it was most probable
that we should be inextricably caught for days or even
weeks in this great mass, I reluctantly gave orders to turn
the ship and make full speed out of this dangerous
situation.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances I could see nothing for it
except to steer for McMurdo Sound and there make our
winter quarters, though I would greatly have preferred
to land at King Edward VII Land, because that region
was quite unknown and we could have added greatly to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">- 43 -</span>
the geographical knowledge of it. However the forces
of these uncontrollable ice-packs are stronger than
human resolution, and a change of plan was forced
upon us.</p>

<p>After more trouble with the ice we worked into clearer
water and the course was set for McMurdo Sound, where
we arrived on January 29 to find that some twenty
miles of frozen ice separated us from Hut Point. I
decided to lie off the ice-foot for some days in the hope
that Nature might break up the ice intervening between
us and our goal.</p>

<p>So far the voyage had been without accident to any
of the staff, but unfortunately on the 31st Mackintosh
was struck in the right eye by a hook, and the eye had
to be removed by Marshall, assisted by the other two
doctors, Michell and Mackay. Keenly as Mackintosh
felt the loss of his eye, his great sorrow was that he would
not be able to remain with us in the Antarctic. He
begged to stay, but when Marshall explained that he
might lose the sight of his other eye he accepted his ill-fortune
without demur.</p>

<p>While waiting at the ice I sent a small partyâ€”consisting
of Adams, Joyce and Wildâ€”to Hut Point to
report on the condition of the hut left there by the
<i>Discovery</i> expedition in 1904, and on their return Adams
reported that the hut was practically clear of snow and
the structure intact.</p>

<p>On February 3 I decided to wait no longer, but to seek
for winter quarters on the east coast of Ross Island; so
we started toward Cape Barne on the look-out for a
suitable landing-place. Steaming slowly north along the
coast we saw across the bay a long, low snow slope connected
with the bare rock of Cape Royds, which seemed
a suitable place for winter-quarters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">- 44 -</span></p>

<p>About eight o'clock I left the ship in a boat, accompanied
by Adams and Wild, and we used the hand-lead at
frequent intervals until we came to fast ice. This
covered the whole of the small bay from the corner of
Flagstaff Point (as we afterwards named the seaward
cliff at the southern end of Cape Royds) to Cape Barne
to the southward. Close up to the Point the ice had
broken out, leaving a little natural dock into which we
ran the boat, and hundreds of Adelie penguins greeted
Adams and me with hoarse squawks of excitement as we
landed. I was soon satisfied that Cape Royds would be
an excellent place at which to land our stores, and after
taking soundings we pulled out towards the ship which
had slowly been coming in. We were pulling along at a
good rate when suddenly a heavy body shot out of the
water, struck the seaman who was pulling stroke, and
dropped with a thud to the bottom of the boat. The
arrival was an Adelie penguin, which had doubtless
thought it was jumping on to a rock, and it would be
difficult to say whether the bird or we were the more
astonished.</p>

<p>By 10 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> on February 3, the <i>Nimrod</i> was moored to
the bay ice, and as soon as she was secured I went ashore
accompanied by Professor David, England, and Dunlop,
to choose a place for building the hut, and up a small
valley we soon found an ideal spot for our winter
quarters.</p>

<p>The floor of this valley was almost level and covered
with a couple of feet of volcanic earth, and there was room
not only for the hut itself, but also for the stores and for
a stable for the ponies. A hill behind this valley served
as an excellent protection from the prevailing strong
south-easterly wind, and a number of seals lying on the
bay ice gave promise of a plentiful supply of fresh meat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">- 46 -</span></p>

<p>With this ideal situation and everything else satisfactory,
including a supply of water from a lake right in
front of our valley, I decided that we had better start
to get our gear ashore at once.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE LANDING OF STORES AND EQUIPMENT</span></h2>
</div>


<p>We now started upon a fortnight full of more checks
and worries than I or any other member of the expedition
had ever experienced. Nevertheless, in face of most
trying conditions, the whole party turned to late and
early with whole-hearted devotion and cheerful readiness.</p>

<p>The ponies gave us cause for the most anxiety, because
in their half-broken and nervous condition it would have
been practically impossible to land them in boats. Finally
we decided to build a rough horse-box, get them into this,
and then sling it over the side by means of the main gaff.
By 3.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on the morning of the 6th we had got all the
ponies ashore, and they immediately began to paw the
snow as they were wont to do in their own far-away
Manchurian home.</p>

<p>The poor ponies were naturally stiff after their constant
buffetings, but they negotiated the tide-crack all right,
and were soon picketed on some bare earth at the entrance
to a valley, which lay about fifty yards from the site of
our hut. We thought this a good place, but in the
future the selection was to cost us dear.</p>

<p>The tide-crack played an important part in connection
with the landing of the stores. In the polar regions,
both north and south, when the sea is frozen, there
always appears between the fast ice, which is the ice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">- 47 -</span>
attached to the land, and the sea ice, a crack which
is due to the sea ice moving up and down with the rise
and fall of the tide. When the bottom of the sea slopes
gradually from the land, sometimes two or three tide-cracks
appear running parallel to each other. When no
more tide-cracks can be seen landwards, the ice-foot has
always been thought to be permanently joined to the
land, and in our case this opinion was strengthened
by the fact that our soundings in the tide-crack shoved
that the ice-foot on the landward side of it must be
aground.</p>

<p>I have explained this fully, for it was only after considering
these points that I, for convenience's sake,
landed the bulk of the stores below the bare rocks on
what I thought was the permanent snow-slope.</p>

<p>On the morning of February 6 we started work with
sledges, hauling provisions and pieces of the hut to the
shore. On the previous night the foundation posts of
the hut had been sunk and frozen into the ground with
a cement composed of volcanic earth and water, and
the digging of the foundations had proved extremely
hard work.</p>

<p>Now that the ponies were ashore it was necessary to
have a party living on shore to look after them, and the
first shore-party consisted of Adams, Marston, Brocklehurst,
Mackay and Murray. Two tents were set up
close to the hut, with the usual sledging requisites such
as sleeping-bags, cookers, &amp;c. The first things landed
this day were fodder for the ponies, and sufficient
petroleum and provisions for the shore-party in case
the ship had to put suddenly to sea owing to bad weather.</p>

<p>The work of hauling the sledge-loads right up to the
land was so heavy, that I decided to let the stores
remain on the snow slope beyond the tide-crack, whence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">- 48 -</span>
they could be taken at leisure. Our attempt to substitute
mechanical haulage for man haulage was not successful,
and we soon had to go back to our original plan.</p>

<p>Delays at once occurred, for during the afternoon of
the 6th a fresh breeze sprung up, and the ship had to
stand out to the fast ice in the strait and anchor there.
Thus two valuable working days were lost.</p>

<p>When, however, I went ashore again I found that the
little shore-party had not only managed to get all the
heavy timber that had been landed up to the site of the
hut, but also had stacked the cases of provisions, which
previously had been lying on the snow slope, upon
bare land. While we were engaged on the increasingly
difficult task of landing stores, &amp;c., the hut-party were
working day and night and the building was rapidly
assuming an appearance of solidity. The uprights were
in and the brace ties were fastened together, so that if
it began to blow there was small fear of the structure
being destroyed. This was something to be thankful
for, but while the hut-party were getting on so well,
we who were engaged on landing the stores hadâ€”owing
to the breaking away of the iceâ€”to move our spot.</p>

<p>The stores had now to be dragged a distance of nearly
three hundred yards from the ship to the landing-place,
but this work was made easier by our being able to use
four of the ponies. A large amount of stores was landed
in this way, but a new and serious situation arose through
the breaking away of the main ice-foot. Prudence
suggested that it would be wiser to shift the stores
already landed to a safer place before discharging any
more from the ship, and on this work we were engaged
during the evening of the 10th.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">- 49 -</span></p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">The "Nimrod" lying off the Penguin Rookery, Cape Royds</span></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">- 50 -</span></p>

<p>Next we had to find a safer place on which to land
the rest of the coal and stores, and Back Door Bay, as
we named the chosen spot, became our new depot. This
was a still longer journey from the ship, but there was
no help for it, and after laying a tarpaulin on the rocks
to keep the coal from mixing with the earth, we started
landing the coal.</p>

<p>By this time there were several ugly looking cracks
in the bay ice, and these kept opening and closing, having
a play of seven or eight inches between the floes. We
improvised bridges, from the motor-car case, so that
the ponies could cross the cracks, and presently were
well under way with the work.</p>

<p>Then there was a most alarming occurrence, for
suddenly and without the slightest warning the greater
part of the bay ice opened out into floes, and the whole
mass that had opened started to drift slowly out to
sea. The ponies on the ice were at once in a perilous
position, but the sailors rushed to loosen the one tied to
the stern rope and got it over the first crack, and
Armytage also got the pony which he was looking after
from the floe nearest the ship on to the next floe.</p>

<p>Just, however, at that moment, Mackay appeared
round the corner from Back Door Bay with a third pony
attached to an empty sledge, on his way back to the ship
to load up. Orders were shouted to him not to come
any further, but not at first grasping the situation he
continued to advance over the ice, which was already
breaking away more rapidly.</p>

<p>When he realised what had occurred he left his sledge
and pony, and rushed towards the place where the other
two ponies were adrift on the ice, and, by jumping the
widening cracks, he reached the moving floe on which
they were standing. This piece of ice gradually grew
closer to a larger piece, from which the animals would
be able to gain a place of safety. But when Mackay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">- 51 -</span>
started to try to get the pony Chinaman across the crack
where it was only six inches wide, the pony took fright,
and rearing and backing towards the edge of the floe,
which had at that moment opened to a width of a few
feet, he fell bodily into the ice-cold water.</p>

<p>It looked indeed as if it was all over with poor Chinaman,
but Mackay hung on to the head rope, and Davis,
Michell and Mawson rushed to his assistance. After
great difficulty a rope sling was passed underneath
Chinaman, and he was lifted up far enough to enable
him to scramble on to the ice.</p>

<p>A few seconds later the floe closed up against the other
one, and it was providential that it had not done so
while the pony was in the water, for in that case Chinaman
would inevitably have been squeezed to death. As
it was he lived to help us very materially on anotherâ€”and
more criticalâ€”day. The ship was now employed to push
the floe back against the fast ice, and directly this was
accomplished the ponies were rushed across and taken
straight ashore, and the men who were on the different
floes took advantage of the temporary closing of the
crack to get themselves and the stores into safety.</p>

<p>As soon as the ship was backed out the loose floes
began to drift away to the west, and after this narrow
escape I resolved not to risk the ponies on the sea ice again.
The breaking of the ice continued to give us great cause
for anxiety, and we had a narrow escape from losing
our cases of scientific instruments and a large quantity
of fodder. Had we lost these cases a great part of our
scientific work could not have been carried out, and
the loss of the fodder would have meant also the loss of
the ponies.</p>

<p>We were handicapped too by such a heavy swell
running on the 13th that no stores could be landed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">- 52 -</span>
This swell would have been welcome a fortnight before,
for it would have broken up a large amount of fast ice
to the south, and I could not help thinking that at this
date there was open water up to Hut Point. Now,
however, it was most unfortunate for us, as precious time
was passing, and still more precious coal was being used
by the continual working of the ship's engines.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE <i>NIMROD</i> LEAVES US</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the swell continued during the following day, I
signalled England to go to Glacier Tongue and land a
depot there. Glacier Tongue lies about eight miles
north of Hut Point and about thirteen to the southward
of Cape Royds, and by landing a quantity of sledging
stores there we should be saved several miles of
haulage.</p>

<p>Although we were busy in building the hut, and in
one way and another had plenty of employment, I was
disappointed at not being able to continue landing the
stores until the 16th. And here I should like to mention
the cheerful assistance which we always received from
the officers and crew of the <i>Nimrod</i>. They had nothing
but hard work and discomfort from the beginning of
the voyage, and yet they worked splendidly and were
invariably in good spirits.</p>

<p>Naturally Captain England was anxious to get the
ship away, and also much concerned about the shrinkage
of the coal-supply, but it was impossible to let her leave
until the wintering party had received their coal from
her. The weather was quite fine, and if it had not been
for the swell we could have got through a great deal of
work.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">- 54 -</span></p>

<p>According to our experiences on the last expedition,
the latest date to which it would be safe to keep the
Nimrod would be the end of February, for the young
ice forming about that time on the sound would seriously
hamper her from getting clear of the Ross Sea.</p>

<p>On the 17th and 18th we contrived to land a considerable
quantity of coal, equipment and stores, but soon after
five o'clock on the afternoon of the 18th a furious blizzard
was blowing, and the <i>Nimrod</i> stood off from the shore
but could make little headway against the terrific wind
and short-rising sea.</p>

<p>I was aboard the vessel at the time, and the speed of
the gusts must have approached a force of a hundred
miles an hour. The tops of the seas were cut off by the
wind, and flung over the decks, mast, and rigging of
the ship, congealing at once into hard ice, and the sides
of the vessel were thick with the frozen sea water.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">"The masts were grey with the frozen spray,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And the bows were a coat of mail."</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Very soon the cases and sledges lying on deck were
hard and fast in a sheet of solid ice, and Harbord, who
was the officer on watch, on whistling to call the crew
aft, found that the metal whistle stuck to his lips, a
painful proof of the low temperature.</p>

<p>The gale raged on for days and nights, and about
midnight on the 21st the <i>Nimrod</i> shipped a heavy sea,
and all the release-water ports and scupper holes being
blocked with ice, the water had no means of exit, and
began to freeze on deck, where, already, there was a
layer of ice over a foot in thickness. Any more weight
like this would have made the ship unmanageable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">- 55 -</span></p>

<p>As the ropes, already covered with ice, would have
frozen into a solid mass, we were forced to take the drastic
step of breaking holes in the bulwarks to allow the
water to escape; and only by dint of great exertions
did Davis and Harbord perform this feat.</p>

<p>It was a sight to see Harbord, held by his legs, hanging
over the starboard side of the <i>Nimrod</i>, and wielding a
heavy axe; while Davis, whose length of limb enabled
him to lean over without being held, did the same on the
other. The temperature at the time was several degrees
below zero, and the wind was as strong as that which
we had experienced in the gales after we had left New
Zealand; though the waves were not so huge as those
which had the whole run of the Southern Ocean in which
to gather strength to buffet us.</p>

<p>At 2 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> the weather suddenly cleared, and we were
able to discover that in spite of our efforts to keep our
position, the wind and current had driven us over thirty
miles to the north. As, however, the sea was rapidly
decreasing we were at last able to steam straight for
Cape Royds.</p>

<p>Arriving ashore early in the morning I rejoiced to see
that the hut was still intact, but the report I received
as regards the warmth of it was not reassuring, because,
in spite of the stove being alight the whole time,
no heat was given off. This eccentric conduct of
the stove was a grave matter, for on its efficiency depended
not only our comfort but our very existence.
The shore-party had experienced a terrific gale, and
the hut had trembled and shaken so much and so constantly
that I doubt if with a less admirable situation we
should have had a hut at all after the gale.</p>

<p>On going down to our main landing-place the full
effect of the blizzard was apparent, for hardly a sign of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">- 56 -</span>
the greater part of our stores was to be seen. Such had
been the force of the wind blowing straight on to the
shore that spray had been flung in sheets over everything,
and had been carried by the wind for nearly a quarter of
a mile inland. Consequently, in places, our precious
stores lay buried to a depth of five or six feet in a mass
of frozen sea water.</p>

<p>We feared that it would take weeks of work to get the
stores clear of the ice, and also that the salt-water would
have damaged the fodder. However there was no time
then to do anything to release the stores from the ice, for
the most important thing was to get the remainder of
coal ashore and send the ship north.</p>

<p>Before 10 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> on February 22 the final boatload of
coal arrived, and as we had in all only about eighteen
tons, the strictest economy would be needed to make
this amount spin out until the sledging parties began
in the following spring.</p>

<p>We gave our final letters and messages to the crew of
the last boat, and said good-bye. And at 10 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> the
Nimrod's bows were pointed to the north, and she was
moving rapidly away from the winter quarters with a
fair wind.</p>

<p>We were all devoutly thankful that the landing of the
stores had at length been finished and that the state of
the sea would no longer be a factor in our work, but it
was with something of a pang that we severed our connection
with the world of men. We could hope for no
word of news from civilisation until the <i>Nimrod</i> came
south again in the following summer, and before that
we had a good deal of difficult work to do and some risks
to face.</p>

<p>There was, however, scant time for reflection, even if
we had been moved that way, and after a good night's
rest we started digging the stores out of the ice, and
transporting everything to the vicinity of the hut.</p>

<p>As soon as the stores were in position we hoped to
make a start with the scientific observations that were to
be an important part of the work of the expedition.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="smaller">WINTER QUARTERS AT CAPE ROYDS OUTSIDE</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next few days were spent in using pick, shovel and
iron crowbars on the envelope of ice that covered our
cases, corners of which only peeped from the mass.</p>

<p>The whole looked like a huge piece of the sweet known
as almond rock, and it was as difficult to get our cases
clear of the ice as it is to separate almonds from that
sticky conglomerate without injury. In this strenuous
labour, however, there was some humour, for Brocklehurst,
who took great interest in the recovery of the
chocolate, spent his energies in rescuing one particular
case which had been covered with ice.</p>

<p>Having rescued it he carried it up to the hut to be
sure of its safety, and was greeted with joy by the Professor,
who recognised in the load some of his scientific
instruments which were playing the part of the cuckoo
in an old chocolate box. Needless to say Brocklehurst's
joy was not as heartfelt as the Professor's.</p>

<p>We were now using the ponies, and within ten days
after the departure of the ship we had practically everything
handy to the hut, excepting the coal. Permanently
we had not lost very much, but we do know that our
one case of beer lies to this day under the ice, and some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">- 59 -</span>
volumes of the Challenger reports, which had been
intended to provide us with useful reading matter during
the winter nights, were only dug out a few days
before our final departure.</p>

<p>Most of us at one time or another had wounds and
bruises to be attended to by Marshall, and the annoying
feature of these simple wounds was the length of time
it took in our special circumstances for them to heal.</p>

<p>The day after the ship left we laid in a supply of fresh
meat for the winter, killing about a hundred penguins
and burying them in a snow-drift close to the hut. By
February 28 we were practically in a position to feel
contented with ourselves, and to explore the neighbourhood
of our winter quarters (See sketch, page 61).</p>

<p>From the door of our hut which faced north-west,
we had a splendid view of the Sound and the western
mountains. Right in front of us lay a small lake which
came to be known as Pony Lake, and to the left of that
was another sheet of ice that became snow-covered in
autumn, and here in the dark months we exercised both
the ponies and ourselves.</p>

<p>Six times up and down the "Green Park," as we
called it, made a mile, and it was here before darkness
fell upon us that we played hockey and football.</p>

<p>To the left of Green Park was a gentle slope leading
down between two cliffs to the sea, and ending in a little
bay known as Dead Horse Bay, and on either side of this
valley lay the penguin rookery.</p>

<p>On coming out of the hut we had only to go round the
corner of the building to catch a glimpse of Mount Erebus,
which lay directly behind us. Its summit was about
fifteen miles from our quarters, but its slopes and foothills
began within three-quarters of a mile of the hut.</p>

<p>Our view was cut off from the east to south-west by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">- 60 -</span>
the ridge at the head of the valley where the hut stood,
but on ascending this ridge we looked over the bay to
the south-east, where lay Cape Barne. To the right
was Flagstaff Point.</p>

<p>There were many localities which became favourite
places for walks, and these are shown on the plan (page 61).
Sandy Beach was generally the goal of any one taking
exercise, when uncertain weather warned us against
venturing further, and while the dwindling light allowed
us to go so far. Here we sometimes exercised the ponies,
and they much enjoyed rolling in the soft sand.</p>

<p>As regards the interest and scenery of our winter
quarters we were infinitely better off than the expedition
which wintered in McMurdo Sound between 1901 and
1904, and as a field of work for geologists and biologists
Cape Royds far surpassed Hut Point. The Professor
and Priestley saw open before them a new chapter of
geological history, for Murray the lakes were a fruitful
field for new research. Adams, the meteorologist, could
not complain, for Mount Erebus was in full view of the
meteorological station, and this fortunate proximity to
Erebus and its smoke-cloud led, in a large measure, to
important results in this branch. Mawson made the
study of ice part of his work, and from every point of
view I must say we were extremely fortunate in the
winter quarters to which the state of the ice had led us.</p>

<p>Before we had been ten days ashore the hut was
practically completed, though it was over a month before
it attained the very fully furnished appearance which it
assumed after every one had arranged his belongings.
It was not a spacious dwelling for fifteen persons, but if
the hut had been larger we should not have been so warm.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">- 62 -</span></p>

<p>At first the coldest part of the house was undoubtedly
the floor, which was formed of inch tongue-and-groove:
boarding, but was not double-lined. There was a space of
about four feet under the hut at one end, and as the
other rested almost on the ground it was obvious to us
that as long as this space remained we should suffer from
the cold. So we decided to make an airlock of the area
under the hut, and to this end we built a wall with the
bulk of provision cases round the south-east and southerly
sides, which were to windward.</p>

<p>On either side of the porch two other buildings were
gradually erected. One, built out of biscuit cases, the
roof covered with felt and canvas, was a store-room for
Wild, who looked after the issue of all food-stuffs. The
building on the other side was far more elaborate, and
was built by Mawson to serve as a chemical and physical
laboratory. It was destined, however, to serve solely
as a store-room, for the temperature inside was so nearly
the same as that outside, that the moist atmosphere
rushing from the hut covered everything inside this
store-room with fantastic ice crystals.</p>

<p>The lee side of the hut ultimately became the wall of
the stables, for we decided to keep the ponies sheltered
for the winter. However the first night they were
stabled none of us had much rest, and some of them
broke loose and returned to their valley. Shortly afterwards
Grisi, one of the most high-spirited of the lot,
pushed his head through a window, so the lower halves
of the hut windows had to be boarded up.</p>

<p>In a store-room built on the south-east of the hut we
kept the tool-chest, the shoe-maker's outfit which was
in constant requisition, and any general stores that had
to be issued at stated times. But the first blizzard
found out this place, and after the roof had been blown
off the wall fell down. When the weather was fine again
we organised a party to search for such things as mufflers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">- 63 -</span>
woollen helmets and so on, and I found a Russian felt
boot, weighing five pounds, lying three-quarters of a
mile from the crate in which it had been stowed. For
the whole of this distance it must have had a clear run
in the air, for there was not a scratch on the leather.</p>

<p>The dog kennels were placed close to the porch of the
hut, and the meteorological station was on the weather
side on the top of a small ridge. Adams was responsible
for this, and as readings of the instruments were to be
taken day and night at intervals of two hours, and as
in thick weather the man trying to go between hut and
screen might possibly lose his way, a line was rigged up
on posts which were cemented into the ground by ice.</p>

<span class="smaller">WINTER QUARTERS INSIDE</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> regards the inside of the hut the first thing done was
to peg out a space for each individual, and we saw that
the best plan would be to have the space allotted in
sections, allowing two men to share one cubicle. This
space for two men amounted to six feet six inches in
length and seven feet in depth from the wall of the hut
towards the centre.</p>

<p>There were seven of these cubicles, and a space for
the leader of the expedition; thus providing for the
fifteen who made up the shore party.</p>

<p>One of the most important parts of the interior construction
was the dark-room for the photographers, and
as we were very short of wood we used cases of bottled
fruit to build the walls. The dark-room was built in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">- 64 -</span>
the left-hand corner of the hut as one entered, and the
cases were turned with their lids facing out, so that the
contents could be removed without the walls being
demolished. The interior of the room was fitted up by
Mawson and the Professor, and as Mawson made the
fittings complete in every detail, the result was as good
as any one under the conditions could desire.</p>

<p>Opposite the dark-room was my room, six feet long,
seven feet deep, built of boards and roofed, the roof
being seven feet above the floor. The bed-place was
made of fruit-boxes, which, when emptied, served, like
those outside, for lockers. My room contained the bulk
of our library, the chronometers, chronometer watches,
&amp;c., and there was ample room for a table. The whole
made a most comfortable cabin.</p>

<p>We set up the acetylene gas-plant on a platform between
my room and the dark-room, for our efforts to work it
from the porch had failed owing to the lowness of the
temperature. The simplicity and portability of this
apparatus and the high efficiency of the light represented
the height of luxury under polar conditions. The only
objectionable feature was the unpleasant smell when the
carbide tanks were being recharged, but although we
were soon used to this, the daily charging always drew
down strong remarks on the unlucky head of Day, who
was responsible for the acetylene plant.</p>

<p>As during the winter months the inside of the hut was
the whole inhabited world to us, some of the distinctive
features of our furnishing may be worthy of mention.
The wall of Adams' and Marshall's cubicle, which was
next to mine, was fitted with shelves made from Venesta
cases, and this apartment was so neat and orderly that
it was known by the address "No. 1 Park Lane." The
beds of this particular cubicle consisted of bamboos
lashed together for extra strength, to which strips of
canvas were attached, so that each bed looked like a
stretcher. These beds took a little longer than the
others to rig up at night, but this disadvantage was
more than compensated for by the free space gained
during the day. The wall end rested on stout cleats
screwed on to the side of the hut, the other end on chairs,
and so supported, the occupant slept very comfortably.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">- 66 -</span></p>

<p>The dividing curtain between this cubicle and the
nextâ€”occupied by Marston and Dayâ€”had been adorned
with life-sized coloured drawings of Napoleon and Joan
of Arc, and as the colour of Joan and also portions of
Napoleon oozed through, the curtain on Marston's side
did not require to be decorated! This cubicle was known
as "The Gables," and in it was set up the lithographic
press. The beds were solid wood, and as Marston was
the artist and Day the handy man of the expedition one
naturally found an ambitious scheme of decoration.</p>

<p>The next cubicle on the same side belonged to Armytage
and Brocklehurst, where everything in the way of shelves
and fittings was very primitive, and next to this cubicle
came the pantry.</p>

<p>Beyond the stove, facing the pantry, was Mackay and
Roberts' cubicle, the main feature of which was a ponderous
shelf, on which socks and other light articles
chiefly rested, the only thing of weight being our gramophone
and records.</p>

<p>Between this cubicle and the next there was no division,
neither party troubling to put one up. The result was
that the four men were constantly at war regarding
encroachments on their ground. Priestley, who was long-suffering,
and who occupied the cubicle with Murray,
said he did not mind a chair or a volume of the "EncyclopÃ¦dia
Britannica" being occasionally deposited upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">- 67 -</span>
him while asleep, but that he drew the line at wet and
dirty boots. This cubicle was garnished on Priestley's
side with bits of rock, ice-axes &amp;c. and on Murray's
with biological requisites.</p>

<p>The next cubicle was occupied by Wild and Joyce,
and was known as the "Rogues' Retreat," a painting of
two very tough characters, with the inscription The
Rogues' Retreat painted underneath, adorning the
entrance to the den. The couches in this house were
the first to be built, and the first bed was made in
Wild's store-room for secrecy's sake. It was to burst
suddenly upon every one and to create feelings of
admiration and envy. Unfortunately, however, in
building it he had forgotten the size of the doorway
through which it had to be taken, and it had ignominiously
to be sawn in half before it could be passed out
of the store-room into the hut.</p>

<p>The last compartment was the dwelling-place of the
Professor and Mawson, and it would be difficult to do
justice to the picturesque confusion of this cubicle. A
miscellaneous assortment of cameras, spectroscopes,
microscopes and the like lay in profusion on the blankets.
Everything in the way of tin cans was collected by these
two scientific men, and the Professor made a pile of
glittering tins and coloured wrappers at one end of his
bunk, and the heap looked like the nest of the Australian
bower bird.</p>

<p>The name given, though not by the owners, to this
cubicle was "The Pawn Shop."</p>

<p>In order to give as much free space as possible in the
centre of the hut, the table was so arranged that it could
be hoisted over our heads after meals were over. At
first we put the boxes containing knives, plates &amp;c. on
top of the table before hauling it up, but after these had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">- 68 -</span>
fallen on the head of the unlucky man trying to get
them down, we were content to keep them on the floor.</p>

<p>After hearing that the stove had failed to work during
the blizzard which had kept me on board the <i>Nimrod</i>, I
was very anxious about it. My anxiety, however, was
dispelled after the stove had been taken to pieces, and
it was found that eight important pieces of its structure
had not been put in. As soon as this more than trifling
omission was rectified the stove worked magnificently,
and as it was kept going day and night for over nine
months without once being put out for more than ten
minutes, it was severely tested.</p>

<p>Looking back to those distant days, it seems strange to
me now that we should have taken so much trouble to
furnish and beautify what after all was to be but a
temporary home. Nevertheless it represented all the
world to its inhabitants, and so we tried to make it as
bright and cheerful a spot as possible.</p>

<p>Divine service was held in the hut on Sundays during
the winter months.</p>

<span class="smaller">SLEDGING EQUIPMENT</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sledge which we used is the outcome of the
experience of many former explorers, but to Nansen is
the chief credit that it has become such a very useful
vehicle.</p>

<p>Our experience on the <i>Discovery</i> expedition had convinced
me that the eleven-foot sledge is the best for all-round
use, but I took with me some twelve-foot sledges
as being possibly more suitable for pony traction. A
good sledge for Antarctic or Arctic travelling must be
rigid in its upright and cross-bars, and yet give to uneven
surfaces. A well-constructed sledge needs to be supple
without interfering with the strength of the structure,
and in our case there was nothing wanting in this respect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">- 69 -</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="img_pg_69" style="width: 587px;">
  <img src="images/img_pg_69.png" width="587" height="416" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Marston in his Bed.</span> (<i>See page 66</i>)</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">- 70 -</span></p>

<p>The wooden runners were about four inches wide and
made of hickory, and in pulling the sledge the direction
of the grain on the snow surface has to be observed, for
it is wonderful what a difference it makes whether one
is pulling with or against the grain of the runner.</p>

<p>The second point to consider is the height of the framework
of the sledge above the surface of the snow, and as
it has been found that a clearance of six inches is ample
in ordinary circumstances, the uprights of our sledges
were only about six inches high.</p>

<p>An eleven-foot sledge, fully loaded, is at its best
working weight with about 650 lb. on it, but this does
not represent its actual strength capacity, for while we
were unloading the ship we often placed over a thousand
pounds' weight on a sledge without damaging it in the
least.</p>

<p>Another vitally important article of equipment for the
polar explorer is the cooker and cooking-stove, and here
again we were indebted to the practical genius of Nansen
who designed the form of cooker that is now invariably
used in polar work. The stove was the ordinary "primus,"
burning kerosene, vapourised in the usual way.</p>

<p>Such was the efficiency of the cooker and stove that,
in a temperature of forty or fifty degrees below zero, the
snow or ice, which would be at this temperature, could
be melted and a hot meal prepared within half an hour
from the time the cooker was placed on the primus.
The whole apparatus, including the primus, did not weigh
more than fifteen pounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">- 71 -</span></p>

<p>The next important item was the tent, and as the
usual unit for sledging consists of three men, our tents
were designed to contain that number. The tent cloth
was thin Willesden duck, with a "snow-cloth" of thicker
material round the lower edge, and instead of a single
tent-pole we used five bamboo rods fastened together at
one end in a cap, over which the apex of the tent fitted.
Inside the tent was placed on the snow a circle of thick
Willesden water-proof canvas to protect the sleeping-bags
from actual contact with the ground.</p>

<p>It has been generally assumed by polar explorers that
sledge travellers must wrap themselves up in furs, but
my experience during two expeditions convinces me that
except for the hands and feet in the way of personal
clothing, and the sleeping-bags for camping, furs are
unnecessary. The term "bag" literally describes this
portion of the sledging gear, for it is a long bag with
closely sewn seams, and is entered by means of a slit at
the upper end.</p>

<p>The appetite of a man who has just come to camp after
a five-hours' march in a low temperature is something
that the ordinary individual at home might possibly envy
but would scarcely understand, and, indeed, the sledger
himself is sometimes surprised when his ration is finished,
and he feels just about as hungry as before his meal.</p>

<p>In choosing supplies I tried to provide those of heat-giving
and flesh-forming materials, and to avoid foods
containing a large amount of moisture. Our cuisine was
not varied, but a voracious appetite has no nice discernment,
indeed all one wants is more, and this is just what
cannot be allowed if a party is to proceed a great distance
while confined to man-haulage. It is hard for a hungry
man to rest content with the knowledge that the food he
is eating is sufficient for his needs, when he does not feel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">- 72 -</span>
satisfied after his meal and the aching void has not even
temporarily disappeared.</p>

<p>Pemmican, which consists of the finest beef powdered
with 60 per cent, of fat added was one of the main items
of our food supply, and biscuits are also a standard food
in polar work.</p>

<p>I secured thicker biscuits than were used in the previous
expedition, and the Plasmon Company supplied a ton of
the best wholemeal biscuit, and with an allowance of one
pound for each man per day we were as regards farinaceous
food considerably better off than those on the <i>Discovery</i>
expedition had been.</p>

<p>This allowance, I may mention, was reduced very
considerably when food began to run short on the
southern and northern journeys, but we had no fault to
find with the quality of the biscuits and the addition of
Plasmon certainly increased their food-value.</p>

<p>Tea and cocoa were chosen as our beverages for use on
the march, tea for breakfast and lunch; and cocoa, which
tends to produce sleepiness, for dinner at night. Sugar
is a very valuable heat-forming substance, and our
allowance of this amounted to about a third of a pound
per day for each man.</p>

<p>We also took chocolate, cheese, and oatmeal, so that
although there was not much variety we felt that we
were getting the most nutritious food possible.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned the clothing which I bought
for the expedition, but as regards the most effective
head-gear there were marked differences of opinion. The
general method, however, of keeping head and ears warm
was to wrap a woollen muffler twice round the chin and
head, thus protecting the ears which are the first parts
of the body to show signs of frost-bite. The muffler was
then brought round the neck, and over the muffler was
pulled a fleecy travelling-cap, a woollen helmet something
like an old-time helmet without the visor.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">- 74 -</span></p>

<p>If a blizzard were blowing the muffler was discarded,
the helmet put on, and over this the Burberry helmet,
which has a stiff flap in front that can be buttoned into
a funnel-shape. In very low temperatures, or even in
moderately low temperature and a breeze, we had
occasionally to inspect each others' faces for the sign of
frost-bite; and if the white patch denoting this was
visible, it had to be attended to immediately.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="smaller">OUR PONIES AND DOGS</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> experiences of the National Antarctic Expedition
and of the <i>Discovery</i> Expedition convinced me, that if we
could use ponies instead of dogs for traction purposes we
should be making a very successful change.</p>

<p>It was a risk to take ponies from the far north through
the tropics, and then across two thousand miles of stormy
sea on a very small ship, but we eventually established
ourselves at the winter quarters with eight ponies.
Unfortunately, however, we lost four of them within a
month of our arrival.</p>

<p>In the case of three out of the four the loss was due to
the facts that they were picketed at first on sandy ground,
and that we did not notice that they were eating the
sand. I had neglected to supply them with salt, and as
they found a saline flavour in the sand they ate it at odd
moments.</p>

<p>Until Sandy died and a post-mortem examination
revealed the cause of his death, we were at a loss to know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">- 75 -</span>
why several of the ponies were ill. Naturally we shifted
them at once to a spot where they could get no more
sand, but in spite of the remedies we gave to them two
more of the ponies died.</p>

<p>The loss of the fourth pony was due to poisoning, for
Manchurian ponies will eat anything that can possibly
be chewed, and this particularâ€”or unparticularâ€”one
seems to have eaten shavings in which chemicals had
been packed. These losses were a matter of the deepest
concern to us.</p>

<p>We were left with four ponies, Quan, Socks, Grisi and
Chinaman, and they were so precious in our eyes that
they were guarded with most keen attention. During
the winter months we had many opportunities to learn
the different characters of each animal, and as every one
of them seemed to possess an extraordinary amount of
sense and cunning, we were not infrequently suffering
from petty annoyances.</p>

<p>Quan was the worst offender, his delight being to bite
through his head-rope and attack the bales of fodder
stacked behind him; then, when we put a chain on him,
he deliberately rattled it against the side of the hut,
which operation kept us awake. Grisi was our best-looking
pony, but he was so unfriendly to the others in
the stables that we had to build him a separate stall.</p>

<p>Socks was shaped like a miniature Clydesdale, and was
always willing to work and very fiery.</p>

<p>The last of our remaining ponies was Chinaman, a
strong animal, sulky in appearance, but in reality one
of the best of workers. He also liked to bite his head-rope,
but when we put a chain on him he did not emulate
Grisi by rattling it against the hut.</p>

<p>We had been able to obtain only nine dogs, but many
puppiesâ€”most of which came to an untimely endâ€”increased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">- 76 -</span>
this number. The presence of the dogs around
our winter quarters was very cheerful and gave a homelike
feeling to the place, and our interest in the pups was
always fresh, for as they grew up each one developed
peculiarities of its own.</p>

<p>All the pups were white and were most useful to us in
guarding the ponies, for if a pony got adrift the little
army of pups, which slept in the stables, at once surrounded
him, and by their furious barking warned the night watchman
that something was wrong.</p>

<p>I remember that on one occasion Grisi got free and
dashed out of the stables followed by the whole party of
pups, and after Mackay had secured the truant the dogs
followed with an air of pride as though conscious of
having done their duty.</p>

<p>Since we were reduced to four ponies it was necessary
to consider the dogs as a possible factor in our work, and
so their training was important. But after enjoying
some months of freedom it seemed terrible to the young
dogs when first a collar was put on them, and even less
did they enjoy their experience of being taken to the
sledge and there taught to pull.</p>

<p>Peary's account of his expeditions shows that in
Arctic regions dogs have been able to traverse long
distances very quickly. Once indeed over ninety miles
were accomplished in twenty-three hours, but this
evidently was done on smooth sea-ice or on the smooth
glaciated surface of the land. Such a feat would be
impossible on the Antarctic Barrier surface.</p>

<span class="smaller">MOUNT EREBUS</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Until</span> March 3 the arrangement of all the details relating
to settling in our winter quarters engaged our
attention, but afterwards we at once began to seek some
outlet for our energies which would advance the cause
of science and the work of the expedition.</p>

<p>I was anxious to make a depot to the south for the
furtherance of our southern journey in the summer, but
the open water between us and Hut Point forbade all
progress in that direction; neither was it possible for us
to journey towards the western mountains, where the
geology might have been studied with the chance of
most interesting results.</p>

<p>One journey, however, was possible, certainly a difficult
one, yet gaining interest and excitement from that very
reason, and this was an attempt to reach the summit of
Mount Erebus.</p>

<p>Both geologically and meteorologically the accomplishment
of this work was desirable, but apart from scientific
considerations the ascent of a mountain over 13,000 feet in
height would be exciting both to those chosen as climbers,
and to the rest of us who wished for their success.</p>

<p>After deliberation I decided that Professor David,
Mawson and Mackay should form the party that was to
try to reach the summit, and they were to be provisioned
for ten days. A supporting-party, consisting of Adams,
Marshall and Brocklehurst, was to assist the main-party
as far as possible, and the whole expedition was to be
under Adams' charge until he decided that his party was
to return, when the Professor was to be in charge of the
advance-party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">- 79 -</span></p>

<p>In my written instructions to Adams, he was given
the option of going to the summit if he thought it feasible
for his party to push on, and he actually did so, though
the supporting-party was only provisioned for six days,
and was not so well equipped for mountain-work as the
advance-party. I also gave instructions that the supporting-party
was not to hamper the main-party, especially
as regarded division of provisions, but instead of being
drawbacks the three men were of great assistance to the
advance division, and lived entirely on their own stores,
and equipment.</p>

<p>No sooner was the decision arrived at to make the
ascent than the winter quarters became busy with the
bustle of preparation, and such was the energy thrown
into this work, that by 8.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on March 5 the men
were ready to start upon the expedition.</p>

<p>In ascending such a mountain as Erebus it was obvious,
that a limit would soon be reached beyond which it would
be impossible to use a sledge. To meet these circumstances
straps were arranged by which single sleeping-bags
could be slung in the form of a knapsack upon the
climber's back, and inside the bags the remainder of the
equipment could be packed. Both the advance and the
supporting-party followed this arrangement.</p>

<p>When they started I confess that I saw but little
prospect of the whole party reaching the top, yet when,
from the hut, on the third day out, we saw through
Armytage's telescope six tiny black spots crawling up
the immense deep snowfield, and when on the next day
I saw the same small figures on the sky-line, I realised
that the supporting-party was going the whole way.</p>

<p>But before I give an account of this expedition as
reported to me most graphically by Professor David and
Adams, I must say something about the mountain on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">- 80 -</span>
which these six men were winning their spurs not only
on their first Antarctic campaign, but also in their first
attempt at serious mountaineering.</p>

<p>The name of Mount Erebus looms large in the history
of polar exploration both north and south. On January
28, 1841, Sir James Clark Ross named the great volcanoâ€”at
whose base our winter quarters layâ€”after the leading
ship of his expedition.</p>

<p>The final fate of that ship is linked with the fate of
Sir John Franklin and one of the most tragic stories of
Arctic exploration, but though both the <i>Erebus</i> and
<i>Terror</i> have sunk far from the scenes of their first exploration,
that brilliant period of Antarctic discovery will
always be remembered by the mountains which took
their names from those stout ships. Standing as a sentinel
at the gate of the Great Ice Barrier, Erebus forms a
magnificent picture. At the top of the mountain an
immense depression marks the site of the old crater, and
from the side of this rises the active cone, generally
marked by steam or smoke. To ascend such a mountain
would be difficult in any part of the world, but the
difficulties were accentuated by the latitude of Erebus.
The men, however, were determined to do their utmost
to reach the crater itself, and how they fared and what
they found must be told from the reports they gave
to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> hands accompanied the expedition when it started
at a quarter to nine on the morning of March 5, and
helped to pull the sledge along the slopes of Back Door
Bay across Blue Lake, up the eastern slope to the first
level; and there we said farewell to the mountain
party.</p>

<p>They first steered straight up a snow slope, and about
a mile out and 400 feet above sea-level a glacial moraine
barred their path, and they had to portage the sledge
over it by slipping ice-axes under the load between the
runners and bearers of the sledge (total weight of sledge
and load was 560 lb.), and lifting it over the obstruction.
On the further side of the moraine was a sloping surface
of ice and nÃ©vÃ©, on which the sledge capsized for the
first time. Light snow was falling and there was a slight
wind.</p>

<p>More difficulties were quickly encountered, and no
sooner had the party managed, by struggling upon
their hands and knees, to drag the sledge up the steep
slope of a small glacier, than their progress was impeded
by sastrugi.</p>

<p>"Sastrugi" means wind furrow, and is the name
given to those annoying obstacles to sledging, due to
the action of the wind on the snow. These sastrugi
vary in depth from two or three inches to three or four
feet, according to the position of any rock masses near
them and to the force of the wind forming them.</p>

<p>Though they have many disadvantages, they are
occasionally very welcome; for sometimes it is impossible
to see the way to steer unless one takes the line of
sastrugi and notes the angle it makes with the compass
course, the compass for the moment being placed on
the snow to obtain the direction.</p>

<p>The sledgers, at this particular juncture, had much
trouble in keeping their feet; and their remarks upon
the subject of sastrugi were distinctly audible and
uncomplimentary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">- 83 -</span></p>

<p>On the first evening the party camped at 6 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>,
about 2750 ft. above sea-level and a distance of seven
miles from winter quarters; and on the following morning
they found that the temperature was 10Â° below zero
Fahr.</p>

<p>The gradient was becoming much steeper, being
1 in 5, and sastrugi, running obliquely to their course,
caused the sledge frequently to capsize. The heavy work,
however, resulted in keeping the travellers warm; and
on the night of March 6 they had reached an altitude
of 5630 ft., and a temperature of 28Â° below zero.</p>

<p>On the following morning Adams decided that the
supporting-party should attempt to reach the summit,
though they were handicapped by having a three-man
sleeping-bagâ€”which article of bulk one man had to
carryâ€”and in various other ways.</p>

<p>The party made a depot of the sledge and of some
of the provisions and cooking utensils at the second
camp, and then, starting with tent-poles among their
equipment, they resumed their climb. Soon, however,
they realised the impossibility of climbing the mountain
with these articles, which had to be taken back to the
depot.</p>

<p>Each man carried a weight of 40 lb., and on the third
evening the party camped about 8750 ft. above sea-level.
Between 9 and 10 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> of the 7th a strong wind
sprang up, and when the men woke the following morning
a fierce blizzard was blowing from the south-east.</p>

<p>In the whirling snow and roaring wind, the two
sections of the party, although only some ten yards
apart, could neither see nor hear each other, and the
blizzard increased in fury as the day wore on.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, however, Brocklehurst emerged
from the three-man sleeping-bag, and instantly a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">- 84 -</span>
fierce gust whirled away one of his wolfskin mits, and
he, dashing after it, was swept down the ravine by the
force of the wind.</p>

<p>Adams, who had left the bag with Brocklehurst, saw
the latter vanish, and in trying to return to the bag to
fetch Marshall, he also was blown down by the wind.
Meanwhile Marshall, the only occupant of the bag, had
great difficulty in keeping himself from being blown,
sleeping-bag and all, down the ravine.</p>

<p>At last Adams, on his hands and knees, succeeded in
reaching the bag, and at the same time Brocklehurst,
also creeping along as best he could, appeared. It was a
close call, for so biting was the cold that he was all but
completely gone.</p>

<p>During the day and night of the 8th the travellers
had nothing to drink, as it would have been impossible
to have kept the lamp alight to thaw out the snow.
Happily, by 4 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> the blizzard was over, and soon
afterwards the climbers were again on their way. The
angle of ascent was now steeper than ever, being thirty-four
degreesâ€”that is, a rise of 1 in 1Â½ and the travellers
kept as much as possible to the bare rocks. During this
day Brocklehurst, who was wearing ski boots, began to
feel the cold attacking his feet, but did not think seriously
enough of it to change into finnesko.</p>

<p>At noon a fair camping-ground was found some 800 ft.
below the rim of the old crater, and after a hasty meal
the ascent was again tackled. Within a little distance
from the top of the rim of the main crater, Mackay chose
to work his way alone with his ice-axe up a long and
very steep nÃ©vÃ© slope, instead of following the safer
route by the rocks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">- 85 -</span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">- 86 -</span></p>

<p>He passed from sight, and then was heard to call out
that he was getting weak, and did not think he could
last much longer. Hastening to the ridge, Marshall and
the Professor dropped to the point where he was likely
to be found, and fortunately met him, thoroughly
exhausted, coming towards them.</p>

<p>It appeared that Mackay had, with his heavy load,
found the work of cutting steps more difficult than he
had expected, and that he had only just managed to
reach safety when he fell and fainted. No doubt this
was partly due to mountain sickness, which under the
severe conditions and at the high altitude also affected
Brocklehurst.</p>

<p>Having found a camping-place, the members of the
party were at leisure to observe the nature of their
surroundings; and they found themselves on the very
brink of a precipice of black rock, forming the inner
edge of the old crater. This wall of dark lava was mostly
vertical, and the base of the cliff was separated from the
snow plain beyond by a deep ditch like a huge dry
moat, evidently due to the action of the blizzards.</p>

<p>But what surprised the explorers most were the extraordinary
structures which rose here and there above the
surface of the snowfield. They were in the form of
mounds and pinnacles of most varied and fantastic
appearance, some resembling beehives, others huge
ventilating cowls, while others were like isolated turrets,
and yet others looked like various animals in shape.</p>

<p>At first sight no one was able to understand the origin
of these remarkable structures, but as it was time for
food, they left the closer investigation until later in the
day.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE CONQUEST OF MOUNT EREBUS</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">While</span> some of the party cooked the meal, Marshall
examined Brocklehurst's feet, as the latter stated that
for some time he had lost all feeling in them. When his
boots and socks were removed it was found that both
his big toes were black, and that four more toes were
also frost-bitten. Ultimate recovery from so severe a
frost-bite was bound to be slow and tedious, though
Marshall's and Mackay's efforts to restore circulation
were, under the conditions, fairly successful. To climb
almost continuously for nine hours with badly frost-bitten
feet up the steep and difficult track must have
required splendid pluck and determination.</p>

<p>After lunch Brocklehurst was safely tucked up in the
three-man sleeping-bag, and the five other members of
the party started off to explore the floor of the old crater,
and the mystery of those remarkable structures was soon
solved by the Professor.</p>

<p>Directing their steps towards one of the ice mounds,
which bore a whimsical resemblance to a lion couchant,
and from which smoke seemed to be issuing, the Professor
recognised that these structures were the outward and
visible signs of fumaroles.</p>

<p>In ordinary climates a fumarole, or volcanic vapour-well,
may be detected by the thin cloud of steam above
it, but in the rigour of the Antarctic climate the fumaroles
of Erebus have their vapour turned into ice as soon as it
reaches the surface of the snow-plain.</p>

<p>Thus ice mounds, somewhat similar in shape to the
sinter mounds formed by the geysers of New Zealand,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">- 88 -</span>
Iceland and Yellowstone Park, are built up round the
orifices of the fumaroles of Erebus.</p>

<p>Next morning when the party got up at 4 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> they had
a splendid view of the shadow of Erebus projected on
the field of cumulus cloud below them by the rising sun,
and while Marshall was attending to Brocklehurst, the
hypsometer, which had become frozen on the way up,
was thawed out, and a determination of the boiling-point
made.</p>

<p>This, when reduced and combined with the mean of
the aneroid levels, made the height of the old crater
rim, just above the camp, 11,400 ft.</p>

<p>At 6 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> the party left the camp, and, hastening to
reach the summit of the present crater, were soon
ascending rather steep slopes, formed of alternating
beds of hard snow and vast quantities of large and perfect
felspar crystals, mixed with pumice. And a little farther
on they reached the base of the volcano's active cone.
Progress now became painfully slow, as the height and
cold combined to make it difficult to breathe.</p>

<p>The cone of Erebus is built chiefly of blocks of pumice,
from a few inches to a few feet in diameter. Externally
these were grey, or often yellow, owing to incrustations
of sulphur, but when broken they were of a resinous,
brown colour.</p>

<p>At last, just after 10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on March 10, the edge of the
active crater was reached, and the little party stood on
the summit of Erebus, the first men to conquer perhaps
the most remarkable summit in the world. From measurements
made while at the crater's edge, Erebus may be
calculated to rise to a height of 13,370 ft. above sea-level.</p>

<p>The report most vividly describes the magnificent and
awe-inspiring scene before the eyes of the travellers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">- 89 -</span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">- 90 -</span></p>

<p>"We stood on the verge of a vast abyss, and at first
could see neither to the bottom nor across it on account
of the huge mass of steam filling the crater and soaring
aloft in a column 500 to 1000 ft. high. After a continuous
hissing sound, lasting for some minutes, there would
come from below a big, dull boom, and immediately
great globular masses of steam would rush upwards to
swell the volume of the snow-white cloud which ever
sways over the crater. This phenomenon recurred at
intervals during the whole of our stay at the crater.
Meanwhile the air around us was extremely redolent of
burning sulphur. Presently a pleasant northerly breeze
fanned away the steam cloud, and at once the whole
crater stood revealed to us in all its vast extent and
depth. Mawson's angular measurement made the depth
900 ft., and the greatest width about half a mile. There
were at least three well-defined openings at the bottom
of the cauldron, and it was from these that the steam
explosions proceeded."</p>

<p>As soon as the measurements had been made and
Mawson had taken some photographs, the party returned
to camp, because it had been decided to start the descent
during the same afternoon.</p>

<p>Numerous specimens of the unique felspar crystals
and of the pumice and sulphur were collected on the way
back to camp, and, having arrived there, the travellers
made a hasty meal, packed up, and started down the
steep mountain slope, Brocklehurst insisting on bearing
his own heavy load in spite of his frost-bitten feet.</p>

<p>Soon a point was reached where the party had either
to retrace their way or to cut steps across a nÃ©vÃ© slope,
or, lastly, to glissade down some 500 or 600 feet to a
rocky ledge below. In their tired state, they chose the
path of least resistance, which was offered by the glissade,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">- 91 -</span>
and consequently the loads were rearranged so that they
might roll down easily. Brocklehurst's load, which contained
the cooking utensils, protested noisily as it went
down, and the aluminium cookers received a severe
battering from their abrupt contact with the rocks
below.</p>

<p>At this time the whole party were suffering from thirst,
but a makeshift drink was obtained by gathering a little
snow, squeezing it into a ball, and placing it on the
surface of a piece of rock, where it melted almost at
once on account of the heat of the sun.</p>

<p>Adams and Marshall were the first to reach the depot,
having dropped down 5000 ft. between 3 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> and 7 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>,
and they found that the blizzard of the 8th had played
havoc with their gear, for the sledge had been overturned
and some of the load scattered to a distance and
partly covered with drift snow. The party camped
during that night at the depot, and by 5.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on the
following morning the sledge was packed and the homeward
journey resumed.</p>

<p>The sastrugi, however, were so troublesome that rope
brakes were put on the sledge-runners, and two men
went in front to pull when necessary, while two steadied
the sledge, and two stayed behind to pull back when
required.</p>

<p>At this time, indeed, the conditions were most trying,
for the sledge either refused to budge or suddenly it
took charge, and overran those who were dragging it.</p>

<p>Capsizes occurred every few minutes, and, owing to
the slippery ground, some of the party who had not
crampons or barred ski-boots were badly shaken up.
One has to experience such a surface to realise how severe
a jar one gets from falling. The only civilised experience
akin to it is when one steps unknowingly on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">- 92 -</span>
slide which some small street-boy has made on the
pavement.</p>

<p>The party reached the spot where they had made
their first camp, six miles distant from Cape Royds, at
7.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> By this time a blizzard seemed to be approaching,
and the snow, which was beginning to drift before
a gusty south-easterly wind, threatened to cut off all
view of the winter quarters. Every one was tired, one
of the tents had a large hole burnt in it, the oil supply
was almost done, and one of the stoves had been put
out of action as the result of the glissade. So in the
circumstances the party decided to make a dash for
Cape Royds, leaving sledge and equipment to be picked
up later.</p>

<p>In the grey light the sastrugi did not show up in
relief, and every few feet some member of the party
fell sprawling over the snow. At last their eyes were
gladdened by the shining surface of the Blue Lake only
half a mile distant from winter quarters. But now that
the stress and the strain were over, their legs grew heavy
and leaden, and that last half-mile seemed to be one of
the hardest they had covered.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, at winter quarters we had been busy
opening cases, with the result that the cubicles of the
absentees were crowded with an accumulation, of stores.
We had just decided to make the cubicles tidy again for
the travellers, and were beginning on the Professor's,
when I left the hut for a moment, and to my astonishment
saw six slowly moving figures within thirty yards
of me.</p>

<p>Running towards them, I shouted, "Did you get to
the top?" and as there was no answer I asked again.
Then Adams pointed with his hand upwards; but, not
satisfied by this, I repeated the question, and Adams
replied "Yes." After that I dashed to the hut and
shouted to the others, who streamed out to cheer the
successful venturers. A good feed followed, in which
porridge had the place of honour.</p>

<p>After some days' delay on account of bad weather, a
party consisting of Adams, the Professor, Armytage,
Joyce, Wild and Marshall started to fetch in the sledge
with the explorers' equipment, and this work was successfully
accomplished.</p>

<p>Among some of the scientific results of this expedition,
as given to me by Professor David, must be mentioned
the calculating of the height of the mountains, and
that "as regards the geological structure of Erebus,
there is evidence of the existence of four superimposed
craters."</p>

<p>"Two features," the Professor wrote, "in the geology
of Erebus which are specially distinctive are: the vast
quantities of large and perfect felspar crystals and the
ice fumaroles.... Its situation between the belt of
polar calms and the South Pole; its isolation from the
disturbing influence of large land masses; its great
height, which enables it to penetrate the whole system
of atmospheric circulation, and the constant steam cloud
at its summit, swinging to and fro like a huge wind vane,
combine to make Erebus one of the most interesting
places on earth to the meteorologist."</p>

<span class="smaller">PREPARATIONS FOR THE WINTER MONTHS</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the journey to the summit of Erebus we began
to prepare for the long winter months that were rapidly
approaching.</p>

<p>It was most important, for instance, that the geologists
should get as far afield as possible before the winter
night closed upon us; so both the Professor and Priestley
were out early and late collecting geological specimens
which would need to be examined later on.</p>

<p>There was also a fine field for Murray's biological
studies; while the lengthening nights gave indications
that the mysterious Aurora Australis would soon be
waving its curtains and beams over our winter
quarters; and as information on this phenomenon
was greatly needed, Mawson prepared to record the
displays.</p>

<p>Adams was the meteorologist of the expedition, and
he took all the observations from 8 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> to 8 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>; while
the night-watchman was responsible for those taken
from 10 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> to 6 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span></p>

<p>In addition to the meteorological screen, Mawson
built an erection on the top of the highest ridge, in which
he placed an aneurometer of his own construction to
register the strength of the heaviest gusts of wind during
a blizzard. Frequently the squalls were found to blow
with a force of a hundred miles an hour.</p>

<p>There remained one more outdoor instrument connected
with weather observation, and that was the snow-gauge.
By using some spare lengths of stove chimney, the
Professor erected a gauge into which the snow falling
in a blizzard was collected, and when it was melted down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">- 96 -</span>
we could calculate fairly accurately the amount of
snowfall.</p>

<p>This observation was very important, as it is on the
precipitation in the form of snow, and on the rate of
evaporation, that calculations regarding the formation
of the huge snowfields and glaciers depend.</p>

<p>As soon as the ice in the bay was strong enough to
bear, Murray prepared to capture the different marine
creatures that rest on the bottom of the sea or creep
about there. His ultimate plan for the capture of
specimens was, whenever a crack opened in the bay ice,
to let down a line, one end being made fast at one end
of the crack, and the length of the line allowed to sink
in the water horizontally for a distance of sixty yards.</p>

<p>A hole was dug at each end of the line, and a small
dredge was let down and pulled along the bottom,
being hauled up through the hole at the far end. By this
means rich collections were made, and rarely did the
dredge come up without some interesting specimens.</p>

<p>Although terrestrial vegetation is very scanty in the
Antarctic, the same cannot be said of the sub-aqueous
plant-life; and the investigations of the plant-life in
the lakes was one of the principal things undertaken
by Murray, Priestley and the Professor during the winter
months.</p>

<p>As the winter approached a regular winter routine
was arranged for the camp, and apart from Brocklehurst,
who was laid up with his frost-bitten foot, all the party
had to do a certain amount of work for the common
weal, apart from their own scientific duties.</p>

<p>From the time we arrived we always had a night-watchman,
and we now took turns to carry out this
important duty, Roberts, who was busy cooking all day,
being the only one who was exempt from night duties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">- 97 -</span></p>

<p>Many as the dutiesâ€”such as taking the meteorological
observations, looking after hut, ponies and dogs, and
keeping up the fireâ€”were, they were not unpleasant:
for when our turn came round we had a chance to wash
clothes, darn socks, and do little jobs which could not
receive much attention during the day. The night-watchman
generally took his bath either once a fortnight
or once a month, as his inclination prompted
him.</p>

<p>The watchman during the earlier months was kept
busy enough, for the ponies were constantly trying to
break loose and, generally speaking, to upset things in
the stable, and it was a comfort when they at last learned
to keep fairly quiet.</p>

<p>Another difficulty the watchman encountered was that
of keeping the hut warm when, instead of lumps of coal,
he had to content himself with very fine stuff. To meet
this difficulty we had recourse to lumps of seal blubber,
and it was good to know that with the large supply of
seals obtainable in these latitudes no expedition need
want emergency fuel.</p>

<p>Towards mid-winter an institution known as eleven-o'clock
tea grew into existence, the Professor being
greatly attached to this, and generally undertaking to
make the tea for the men still out of bed. By one o'clock,
however, most of the hut party were wrapped in more
or less noisy slumber. The watchman's most trying time
was about five o'clock in the morning: for then one's
eyes grew heavy, and great effort was needed to prevent
oneself from falling asleep.</p>

<p>At 7.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> Roberts was called, and at this hour
Armytage or Mackay was roused up to feed the ponies;
but before mid-winter day Armytage took over the
entire responsibility of the stables and ponies. At<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">- 98 -</span>
8.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> all hands were called, special attention being
paid to turning out the messman for the day; and at
nine o'clock sharp every one sat down to breakfast.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<span class="smaller">STILL IN THE HUT</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> duties of the messman were more onerous than
those of the night watchman, and began by laying the
tableâ€”a simple operation owing to the primitive conditions
under which we lived. He then garnished this with
hot sauces to tickle some of our tough palates, and when
we sat down he passed up bowls of porridge and the big
jug of hot milk, which was the standing dish every day.</p>

<p>Then came the messman's order, "Up bowls," and,
reserving our spoons, the bowls were passed along. If
it were a "fruit day"â€”a day when the second course
consisted of bottled fruitâ€”the bowls were retained for
this popular dish.</p>

<p>After he had been assisted in washing up the breakfast
things, the duty of the man in the house was to fill the
melting-pots with ice, empty the ashes and tins into the
dust-box outside, and get in a bag of coal. One often
heard the messman anxiously enquiring what the dinner
dishes consisted of, the most popular, from his point
of view, being those which resulted in the least amount
of grease on the plates. The hut was swept out three
times a day, so that the building was kept in a tidy
state.</p>

<p>It would only be repetition to chronicle our doings
from day to day, during the months that passed from
the disappearance of the sun until the welcome daylight
returned. We lived under conditions of steady routine,
and having more than enough to occupy us in our daily
work that spectre known as "Polar ennui" never
appeared.</p>

<p>At night some of us played bridge, poker and
dominoes; but Joyce, Wild, Marston and Day spent
much time in the production of the "Aurora Australis,"
the first book ever written, printed, illustrated and
bound in the Antarctic.</p>

<p>Messrs. Joseph Causton &amp; Sons, Ltd., had generously
given us a complete printing outfit and the paper for the
book, and Joyce and Wild had been instructed in type-setting
and printing, Marston being taught etching and
lithography.</p>

<p>They had hardly become skilled craftsmen, but although
the early days of the printing department were not exactly
happy, the work progressed steadily, until at the end of
a fortnight or so two pages could be printed a day.
Day meanwhile prepared the binding by cleaning,
planing and polishing wood taken from the venesta
cases, while Marston reproduced the illustrations by
printing from aluminium plates.</p>

<p>Marston was handicapped by the fact that all our
water had a trace of salt in it, but he managed to produce
what we all regarded as creditable pictures. In its final
form the book consisted of about 120 pages; and at
any rate it had helped to guard us from a dangerous
lack of occupation during the polar night.</p>

<p>On March 13 we experienced a very fierce blizzard,
and cases weighing from 50 to 80 lb. were actually shifted
from their positions; so when the gale was over we put
everything that could possibly blow away into places
of greater safety.</p>

<p>On this day Murray found living microscopical animals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">- 101 -</span>
on some fungus that had been thawed out from a lump
of ice taken from the bottom of one of the lakes, this
being one of the most interesting discoveries that had
been made in the Antarctic, for the study of these minute
creatures threw a new light on the capability of life to
exist under conditions of extreme cold and in the face
of great variations of temperature.</p>

<p>From our point of view, it was humorous to see
Murray trying to slay the little animals he had found.
He used to thaw them from a block of ice, freeze them
up again, and repeat this process several times without
causing the rotifers any inconvenience. Then he tested
them in brine so strongly saline that it would not freeze
at a temperature above minus 7Â° Fahr., and still the
animals lived, and a good proportion of them survived
a temperature of 200Â° Fahr. It became a contest between
rotifers and scientist, and generally the rotifers seemed to
triumph.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Tongue and pencil would sadly fail to describe the
magic of the colouring in the days when the sun was
leaving us. The very clouds at this time were iridescent
with rainbow hues. The change from twilight into night,
sometimes lit by a crescent moon, was extraordinarily
beautiful, for the white cliffs gave no part of their
colour away, and the rocks beside them did not part
with their blackness; so the effect of deepening night
over these contrasts was singularly weird. Throughout
April hardly a day passed without an auroral display,
and about the beginning of that month the temperature
began to drop considerably, and in calm, still weather
the thermometer often registered 40Â° below zero.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On April 6 Marshall decided that it was necessary to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">- 102 -</span>
amputate Brocklehurst's big toe, as there was no sign
of its recovery from frost-bite; and the patient having
been put under chloroform, the bone was removed, and
the sufferer moved to my room, where he remained till
just before mid-winter's day.</p>

<p>When mid-winter's day had passed, and the twilight
became daily more marked, I set on foot arrangements
for the sledging work in the following spring. For it was
desirable that, at the earliest possible date, a depot of
stores should be placed at a point to the south, in preparation
for the departure of the Southern Party, which
was to march towards the Pole. This depot I hoped to
make at least a hundred miles from the winter quarters.</p>

<p>It was also desirable that definite information should
be obtained regarding the condition of the snow surface
on the Barrier; and I also wanted various members
of the party to have practice in sledging before the
serious work began. Considering our scarcity of ponies,
I resolved that these preliminary sledging journeys should
be performed by man-haulage.</p>

<p>During the winter I had given earnest consideration
to the question of the date on which the party that
was to march towards the Pole should leave the hut.
Our hoped-for goal lay over 880 statute miles to the
south, and the brief summer was all too short a time
in which to march so far into the unknown and return.
The ship would have to leave for the north about the
end of February, for the ice would then be closing in;
and, moreover, we could not hope to carry on our sledges
much more than a three months' supply of provisions
on anything like full rations.</p>

<p>Finally, I resolved that the Southern Party should
leave mid-winter quarters on October 28, for by starting
earlier the ponies would probably suffer from the severe
cold at nights; and if the ponies were quickly incapacitated,
we should have gained no advantage from our
early start.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">- 104 -</span></p>

<p>But the date having been fixed, it became necessary
to arrange for the laying of the depot during the early
spring, and I thought that the first step towards this
should be a preliminary journey on the Barrier surface,
so that we might gain an idea of the prevailing conditions,
and find out if the motor-car would be of service for at
any rate the early portion of the journey.</p>

<span class="smaller">PRELIMINARY JOURNEYS</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sun had not yet returned and the temperature was
exceedingly low, but the <i>Discovery</i> expedition had proved
that it is quite possible to travel under these conditions.
Accordingly I started on this preliminary journey on
August 12, taking with me Professor David, who was to
lead the Northern Party towards the South Magnetic
Pole, and Bertram Armytage who was to take charge of
the party that was to journey into the mountains of the
west later in the year.</p>

<p>We were equipped for a fortnight with provisions and
camp gear, packed on one sledge, and had three gallons
of petroleum in case we decided to stay out longer. A
gallon will last three men for about ten days, and we
could get more food at Hut Point if we required it. We
took three one-man sleeping bags, for although the larger
bags are certainly warmer one's rest in them is very likely
to be disturbed by the movements of a companion.</p>

<p>At first the weather was bad and consequently progress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">- 105 -</span>
was slow, but although the temperature was about forty
degrees below zero we slept soundly at night, and arose
praising the one-man sleeping bags.</p>

<p>We reached the old <i>Discovery</i> winter quarters at Hut
Point on the morning of August 14, and I took the
Professor and Armytage over all the familiar ground.</p>

<p>To me the revisiting of these old scenes was supremely
interesting. Here was the place where, years before,
when the <i>Discovery</i> was lying fast in the ice close to the
shore, we used to dig for the ice required for the supply of
fresh water. The marks of the picks and shovel could
still be seen, and I noticed an old case bedded in the ice,
and remembered the day when it had been thrown away.
The fascination of the unknown swept upon me as I
stood in those familiar surroundings, and I longed to be
away towards the south on the journey that I hoped
would lay bare the mysteries of the Pole.</p>

<p>The old hut had never been a cheerful place even when
we were camped alongside it in the <i>Discovery</i>, and it
looked doubly inhospitable now after standing empty for
six years. I proposed, however, to use it as a stores
depot in connection with the southern journey, for it was
twenty miles further south than our winter quarters. We
slept there that night and on the following morning started
for our journey across the Barrier.</p>

<p>The chief result of this expedition was to convince me
that we could not place much reliance on the motor-car
for the southern journey, because the condition of the
surface on the Barrier varied from mile to mile, and it
would be impossible to keep changing the wheels of the
car so as to meet the requirements of each new surface.</p>

<p>Professor David and Armytage had also received a good
baptism of frost, and as it was desirable that every
member of the expedition should have personal experience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">- 106 -</span>
of travelling over ice and snow in low temperatures before
the real work began, I arranged to dispatch a small party
every week to sledge stores and equipment south to Hut
Point.</p>

<p>I did not hesitate to let these parties face bad weather,
because the road was well known, and a rough experience
would be useful to men later on. Each party returned
with adventures to relate, and curiously all of them
encountered bad weather, but there were no accidents
and the men seemed to enjoy the work.</p>

<p>Early in September Adams, Marshall and I started
for Hut Point, and decided to make one march of the
twenty-three miles, and not camp on the way. A
blizzard, however, struck us when we were near our goal,
and abandoning the extra weights we were pulling for the
depot, we managed to reach the hut in a sorely frost-bitten
condition. I mention this to show how constantly one has
to guard against the onslaughts of the elements in the
inhospitable regions of the south.</p>

<p>By the middle of September a good supply of provisions,
oil and gear was stored at Hut Point, in fact everything
needed for the southern journey had been taken there so
that the start might be made from the most southern
base available. Also while the men were gaining experience
the ponies were being given exercise, and I felt that
these little Manchurian animals were going to justify my
confidence. After many experiments I concluded that
650 lb. per pony should be the maximum load, this weight
including the sledge itself which weighed about 60 lb.</p>

<p>When the question of weight came to be considered
I realised more than ever the seriousness of the loss of the
other four ponies. It was evident that we could not take
to the Pole as much food as I would have liked.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">- 108 -</span></p>

<p>On September 22 I started out again with a party
consisting of Adams, Marshall, Wild, Marston and Joyce
and myself to place a depot 160 statute miles south of the
<i>Discovery</i> winter quarters, the depot to consist of pony
maize. The loads were about 170 lb. per man, and the
journey was a severe one, for at times the temperature got
down to 59Â° below zero Fahr.</p>

<p>We reached the main depot in latitude 79Â° 36â€² South,
longitude 168Â° East on October 6, and this we called
"Depot A." It was marked with an upturned sledge
and a black flag on a bamboo rod, and here we deposited
a gallon tin of oil and 167 lb. of pony maize so that our
load would be materially reduced for the first portion of
the journey south.</p>

<p>The weather was shockingly severe on our return
journey, and we did not reach the old <i>Discovery</i> winter
quarters until October 13, but continuing our march
home on the following day we were lucky enough to meet
the motor-car, and with the sledges hitched on, we drove
triumphantly back to winter quarters.</p>

<p>During our absence the Northern Party, consisting of
Professor David, Mawson and Mackay, had started on
their journey to the South Magnetic Pole. I said good-bye
to the Professor and his two companions on September 22
and we did not meet again until March 1, 1909.</p>

<span class="smaller">ARRANGEMENTS AND INSTRUCTIONS</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Southern Party was to leave winter quarters on
October 29, so on our return from Depot A we began
finally to prepare for our attempt to reach the South
Pole. I decided that Adams, Marshall and Wild should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">- 109 -</span>
go with me and that we should take provisions for
ninety-one days. This amount of food with other equipment
brought the load per pony up to the weight fixed as
the maximum safe load. The supporting party was to
accompany us for some distance so that we might start
fairly fresh from a point beyond the rough ice off Minna
Bluff, and we were to take the four ponies and four
sledges.</p>

<p>Early in 1907 I had proposed that one party should
travel to the east across the Barrier surface towards
King Edward VII Land, but the loss of so many ponies
caused me to abandon this project.</p>

<p>Arrangements, however, were made for sending out
a party early in December to lay a depot for the Northern
Party, and when this was done, the same men were to
proceed to the western mountains.</p>

<p>Also on January 15, 1909, a party under Joyce, was
to lay a depot near Minna Bluff containing sufficient
stores for the return of the Southern Party from that
point. This same party was to return to Hut Point,
reload and march out to the depot a second time, and
await the arrival of the Southern Party until February 10,
1909. If the Southern Party had not arrived by that
date, Joyce and his companions were to go back to Hut
Point and thence to the ship.</p>

<p>Before my departure I left instructions which provided
for the conclusion of the work of the Expedition in its
various branches, and for the relief of the men left in the
Antarctic in the event of the non-return of the Southern
Party.</p>

<p>To Murray I gave command of the Expedition and
full instructions during my absence.</p>

<p>The provisioning of the Southern Party was long and
anxiously considered, and Marshall went very carefully
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">- 110 -</span>
into the question of the relative food-values of the various
supplies, and we were able to derive much useful information
from the experience of previous expeditions.</p>

<p>At length we decided that the daily allowance of food
for each man on the journey, as long as full rations were
given, was to be as follows:</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <td></td>
  <td class="tdc">Oz.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Pemmican</td>
  <td class="tdc">7Â·5</td>

  <td class="tdl">Emergency Ration</td>
  <td class="tdc">1Â·5</td>

  <td></td>
  <td class="bdt tdc">34Â·0</td>

</table>

<p>Tea, salt, and pepper were extras not weighed in with
the daily allowance. We used about two ounces of tea
per day for the four men, and the salt and pepper were
carried in small bags, each bag to last one week.</p>

<p>Everything was ready for the start as the end of
October approached, and we looked forward with keen
anticipation to the venture. The supporting-party, consisting
of Joyce, Marston, Priestly, Armytage, and
Brocklehurst, was to accompany us for the first ten days.</p>

<p>The weather was not very good towards the end of
October, but there were signs that summer was coming.
We spent the last days overhauling sledges and equipment,
and our evenings in writing letters for those at home,
to be delivered in the event of our not returning from the
unknown regions into which we hoped to penetrate.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE START TO THE SOUTH POLE</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Brilliant</span> sunshine and a cloudless sky were an auspicious
beginning to the day on which we started upon our
attempt to plant the Union Jack, which the Queen had
given us, on the last untrodden spot of the world. Yet
on leaving the hut where we had spent so many months
in comfort, we had a feeling of real regret that never
again should we all be together.</p>

<p>The supporting-party started first, and at 10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> we
said good-bye to Murray and Roberts, who were to be left
behind, and we four of the Southern Party followed
with an intense desire to do well for the sake of every one
concerned in the Expedition.</p>

<p>Hardly, however, had we been marching for an hour
when mishaps began to occur. First of all Socks went
dead lame, and soon afterwards, when we were halting
to feed ourselves and the ponies, Grisi lashed out and
struck Adams just below the knee.</p>

<p>Three inches higher and the blow would have shattered
both his knee-cap and his hopes of reaching the South
Pole. As it was the bone was almost exposed and he
was in great pain, although he said very little about it.
What he would have done if he had been completely
knocked out it is impossible to imagine, as his interest
in the Expedition was intense.</p>

<p>On October 30 we reached Hut Point and with Adams
better, the ponies recovered from their lameness, and
the weather gloriously fine, we rejoiced to be out at last
on the long trail.</p>

<p>Quan fit or unfit was the most mischievous of all the
ponies, for when any one was looking his special delight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">- 113 -</span>
was to bite his tether, and unfortunately he did this on
one occasion when no one was watching him and played
havoc with the maize and other fodder. When we tried
to catch him he dashed from one sledge to another tearing
bags to pieces and trampling the food out, kicking up his
heels and showing that he was deliberately destructive,
for his distended appearance proved that he had eaten
more than his fill.</p>

<p>We left the sea ice on November 3, but instead of finding
a better surface on the Barrier, we discovered that the
going was more difficult than ever. The ponies, however,
pulled magnificently and every hour the pony-leaders
changed places with the sledge-haulers. On the next
day we wore goggles, as we were already feeling the trying
light, and as soon as we had passed the end of White
Island the surface became softer and it was trying work
for both men and ponies. Still, however, we tramped
along, the supporting-party pulling magnificently, and
our march for the day was over sixteen miles.</p>

<p>Up to this time we had been blessed with fair weather,
but on Guy Fawkes' Day we encountered driving snow
which made our steering very wild. In the bad light
the sastrugi could not be seen, and the surface was very
bad for both ponies and men. Minor mishaps were
natural under such conditions, and after Marshall, who
was leading Grisi, had got his legs into a crevasse, and
soon afterwards Wild, Adams and Marshall had got into
another crevasse, there was nothing for it but to pitch
camp and wait until the weather cleared.</p>

<p>To our sorrow we had to lie during the whole of the
next day in our sleeping-bags except when we went out
of them to feed the ponies, for a blizzard was upon us
with thick drift. One can scarcely realise how trying it
is to be held up by blizzards, unless one has been on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">- 114 -</span>
polar expedition and knows that each lost day means
also the consumption of 40 lb. of pony feed alone. Nevertheless,
we endeavoured to make the best of an irritating
situation, and in our one-man sleeping-bags each of us
had a little home, where he could read and write and look
at his household godsâ€”if he had brought any with him.</p>

<p>During the morning I passed the time reading <i>Much
Ado About Nothing</i>â€”an inappropriate play perhaps for
me to be reading when I was worrying over our delay
and thought that I had good cause to be.</p>

<p>The blizzard would not have mattered so much if we
had only to consider ourselves, for we could save on the
food, but if the ponies were to be of much use to us they
had to be properly fed.</p>

<p>On the 7th the weather was better, though still very
thick and overcast, and cheered by the supporting-party,
who were returning to winter quarters, we started off
with the ponies pulling splendidly. But almost immediately
we found ourselves in a maze of crevasses. The
first one which Marshall crossed with Grisi was 6 ft. wide,
and when I looked down there was nothing to be seen but
a black yawning void.</p>

<p>Crevasses were here, there, and everywhere, and we
had to camp between two large ones and wait until the
light became better, for to proceed in such weather was
to court disaster.</p>

<p>At last we were quite on our own resources, and as
regards comfort in the tents were very well off, for with
only two men in each tent there was plenty of room.
Adams began by sharing a tent with me, but we decided
to shift about so that we could take turns with each other
as tent-mates.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">- 116 -</span></p>

<p>In respect to books also we were well supplied, for I
took Shakespeare's Comedies with me, Marshall had
Borrow's "The Bible in Spain," Adams, Arthur Young's
"Travels in France," and Wild "Sketches by Boz."
By changing round when we had finished, we had literature
enough to keep us going for many hours when we were
unable to march.</p>

<p>No literature, however, could prevent us from chafing
at the weather which kept us in our bags until the
morning of November 9, but the difficulties of travelling
over snow and ice in a bad light are practically insurmountable.</p>

<p>When the light is diffused by clouds or mist, it casts no
shadows on the dead white surface, which consequently
appears to the eye to be uniformly level. Often when
we thought that we were marching on a level surface,
we would suddenly fall two or three feet, and the strain
on the eyes under these conditions was very great.</p>

<p>It is, indeed, when the sun is covered and the weather
thickish that one is in danger of snow-blindness, that
painful complaint with which we all became too well
acquainted during the southern journey.</p>

<p>The only way to guard against an attack is to wear
goggles the whole time, but when one is perspiring on
account of exertion with the sledges, the glasses fog and
they have to be taken off so that they may be wiped.
When they were removed, the glare from the surrounding
whiteness was intense, and the only relief was to get
inside a tent, which was made of a green material very
restful to the eyes.</p>

<p>On the night of the 8th the weather cleared, and we
saw that we were in a regular nest of crevasses, Marshall
and Wild finding that their tent was pitched on the edge
of a previously unseen one.</p>

<p>To stand in drift for four days with 24Â° of frost was
so bad for the ponies that we were thankful that their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">- 117 -</span>
appetites for the hot food we gave to them was not
affected, but we wanted to get under way and put
some good marches in before we could feel really happy.</p>

<p>The distance as the crow flies from our winter quarters
to the Pole is 750 geographical miles and as yet we had
only done fifty-one. That a polar explorer needs a large
stock of patience in his equipment is not to be denied,
and as we lay in our bags anxious to be marching yet
unable to move we drew heavy draughts upon our stock.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII<br />
<span class="smaller">ONWARD</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> morning of the 9th was fine, calm and clear, and,
as soon as we had dug the sledges out of the drift and
breakfasted, we set out to find a track among the
crevasses. Our hunt for crevasses was successful enough,
for we discovered all sorts from narrow cracks to ugly
chasms with no bottom visible, but to find a track through
them was beyond our powers.</p>

<p>There was indeed nothing for it but to trust to Providence,
and having got under way we got over the first
few crevasses without difficulty. And then all of a
sudden Chinaman went down a crack which ran parallel
to our course.</p>

<p>Adams tried to pull him out and he struggled gamely,
but it was not until Wild and I left our sledges and hauled
along Chinaman's sledge that, just in time, he managed
to get on to firm ice, for three feet more and it would have
been all up with the Southern Journey. The three-foot
crack opened out into a great fathomless chasm, and
down that would have gone the pony, all our cooking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">- 118 -</span>
gear and biscuits and half the oil, and probably Adams
as well.</p>

<p>But when things seem to be as hopeless as possible
they often take a sudden change for the better, and in
our case this was the last crevasse we encountered for
some time, and at length, with a gradually improving
surface, we were really able to push along.</p>

<p>During the day we knocked off over 14 miles of those
intervening between us and our goal, and we turned in
for the night in a more cheerful frame of mind. Our
rest, however, was disturbed by the mischievous Quan
eating away the straps on his rug, and Grisi and Socks
fighting over it. The propensities of Manchurian ponies
for eating peculiar things must certainly be allowed to
have their drawbacks.</p>

<p>Such accidents may seem very trivial, but they meant
work for us in repairing the damage, and when one is
thoroughly tired after a day's march one does not welcome
any unlooked for labour.</p>

<p>To our astonishment during our march in the afternoon
we came across the track of an Adelie penguin, and where
on earth the bird had come from was a mystery. It had
been travelling on its stomach for a long way, and it had
at least fifty miles to travel before it could reach food
and water, and the nearest water in the direction from
which it had come was over fifty miles away. Among
penguins this bird ought, I think, to have been credited
with an adventurous disposition.</p>

<p>With better weather for the next few days we made
good progress towards the depot where 167 lb. of pony
food was lying, and our appetites were already too good
for the amount of food we were allowing ourselves.
Perhaps those who have never known what it is to be
desperately hungry will be disgusted at us for remembering
that when the ponies had done their work we should be
able to add horse-meat to our rations. But I can say
with truth that until the ponies had to be killed they
were treated with a liberality that we denied sternly to
ourselves.</p>

<p>To pick up a depot which is only a tiny speck in a vast
snowy plain and is nearly sixty miles from the nearest
land, is like picking up a buoy in the North Sea with only
distant mountains for bearings, and I was most anxious
that we should reach it before the glorious weather broke
up, for there was stored not only the pony feed but also
a most valuable gallon of oil.</p>

<p>Imagine then my delight when, on the evening of the
14th, Wild, who was outside the camp looking through
the Goertz glasses, shouted that he could see the depot.
We rushed out at once, and there were the flag and sledge
to be seen plainly through the glasses. On the next
morning we found everything intact and the flag waving
merrily in the breeze, and we camped there for a few
hours so that we could distribute weights and parcel our
provision to be left there for our return journey.</p>

<p>It went to our hearts to leave a tin of sardines and a
pot of black currant jam which we had intended for our
feast on Christmas Day, but every ounce of additional
weight was so important, that although we felt that we
ought to take as much food as we possibly could these
luxuries had to be left behind.</p>

<p>We were on again soon after one o'clock and when we
camped that night we built a snow mound as a guide
to our homeward track, and decided to build one at each
camp we made. Having two shovels with us, in ten
minutes a mound 6 or 7 ft. high could be built, and
although we wondered whether our tracks would remain
longer than our mounds, or our mounds longer than the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">- 121 -</span>
tracks, we thought it most advisable to neglect no precautions.
And as a matter of fact these mounds remained
after the sledge tracks had vanished, and were a great
comfort to us on our journey back.</p>

<p>Everything continued to go splendidly for us, and I
could not help contrasting the progress of our last few
days with the time six years before, when I was toiling
along five miles a day over the same ground.</p>

<p>On November 16, for instance, we covered over 17
miles, a record day for us; and also every one was in
splendid health, my eyes (which had been attacked by
snow blindness) were better, and although split lips
prevented us laughing we were going straight as a die to
the southâ€”a reason sufficient in itself for our cheerfulness.</p>

<p>Another opportunity for contrast was that between our
parsimony in the way of food and Quan's wastefulness.
To economise we saved three lumps of sugar each day so
that in time we might build up a reserve stock, while
Quan with his marvellous digestion preferred to
eat a yard of creosoted rope than his proper bait, and
often in sheer wantonness threw the food given to him all
over the snow.</p>

<p>By this time the work was beginning to tell upon the
ponies, especially upon Chinaman, but all of them continued
to work splendidly in their own particular way,
and naturally we were anxious to advance our food-supply
as far as possible south before the ponies gave out.</p>

<p>Quan plodded stolidly through everything, possibly
thinking of what tricks he would play at night but at the
same time working magnificently; Chinaman was the
first to show signs of collapse, but his spirit was willing
though his strength was weakening; Grisi and Socks
took all soft places with a rush.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">- 122 -</span></p>

<p>But in spite of the hard labours of the day we always
felt confident that the ponies would enjoy themselves
in their peculiar way at night, and on one occasion I had
to go out to prevent Socks from biting and swallowing
lumps out of Quan's tail. If we had ever anticipated
that they would have played such games, we should have
taken a longer wire to tether them and keep them apart.</p>

<span class="smaller">BEYOND ALL FORMER FOOTSTEPS</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> November 18 I imagined that we had reached the
windless area of the Pole, for the Barrier was a dead,
smooth, white plain, weird beyond description, and,
having no land in sight, we felt tiny specks in the immensity
around us. It seemed as though we were in some
other world, and yet the things that concerned us most
were such trifles as split lips and big appetites.</p>

<p>Already the daily meals were all too short, and we
wondered what it would be like when we were really
hungry. However, we were moving on at a rate of about
fifteen miles a day, and every night that we camped we
felt that another long step towards our desire had been
made.</p>

<p>Soon I discovered that I was wrong in thinking that
we had reached the windless area, for all the sastrugi
began to point due south, but the whole place and conditions
were so unlike anything else in the world of our
experience, that it was extremely difficult to make correct
forecasts as to what we should next encounter.</p>

<p>At one moment I thought of Coleridge's "Ancient
Mariner": "Alone, alone; all, all alone, alone on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">- 123 -</span>
wide, wide sea"; and then, when the mazy clouds sprung
silently up and, not followed by any wind, drifted quickly
across our zenith, the only word to describe my feeling
is uncanny.</p>

<p>It was as though we were truly at the world's end, and
were bursting in on the birthplace of the clouds and the
nesting-home of the four winds, and we could not suppress
a feeling that we mortals were being watched with a
jealous eye by the forces of nature.</p>

<p>Still, in spite of these sensations, which every one who
goes out into the intensely lone places of the world must
experience, we were more interested in such things as
heavy going and soft surfaces than in anything else, for
the surface was all-important to us and played the leading
part in our day's work.</p>

<p>On November 20 we met with a terribly soft surfaceâ€”so
bad, in fact, that it sounded the death-knell of poor
old Chinaman, who was no longer able to keep up with
the others; and so we had to shoot him on the following
day.</p>

<p>Let me say again that the killing of the ponies was not
pleasant work, and that our only satisfaction was in
knowing that they were well fed up to the last, and had
suffered no pain. When we had to kill a pony we threw
up a snow-mound to leeward of the camp, and took the
animal behind this out of sight of the others.</p>

<p>Of necessity we had to eat the meat, and as within a
very short time after killing the carcase was frozen solid,
we always tried to cut the meat into small pieces before
this occurred.</p>

<p>On the same day that saw the death of Chinaman we
made our second depot, and left there 80 lb. of pony
meat, one tin of biscuits weighing 27 lb., some sugar, and
one tin of oil to see us back to Depot A.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">- 124 -</span></p>

<p>With three ponies dragging 500 lb. each we left our
depot, with its black flag flying on the bamboo lashed to
a discarded, sledge, and were soon in new land to the
southâ€”land never before seen by human eyes.</p>

<p>The land consisted of great snow-clad heights rising
beyond Mount Longstaff, and also far inland to the north
of Mount Markham. We found that our latitude was
81Â° 8â€² south.</p>

<p>The weather still remained splendid for marching, with
a cool breeze from the south and the sun slightly hidden,
but our enjoyment of the glorious view of peaks new to
human eyes was marred by Wild being temporarily
unwell, and by Adams suffering badly from toothache.
Our first attempt to pull out this tooth merely resulted
in the tooth breaking, but at a second attempt Marshall
succeeded in getting it out, an achievementâ€”under the
conditionsâ€”as creditable to the one as it was welcome
to the other.</p>

<p>Steady progress was made until November 26, which
is a day which we travellers at least shall remember, for
on it we passed the "farthest south" previously reached
by man. On this night we reached latitude 82Â° 18 south,
and our "farthest south" in the march with Captain
Scott was 82Â° 16Â½â€².</p>

<p>As each hour passed on this memorable day we found
new interest to the west where the land lies, for we opened
out Shackleton Inlet, and up the inlet a great chain of
mountains, and far into the west still more peaks. To
the west of Cape Wilson another chain of peaks about
10,000 ft. high appeared, and to the south-south-east
new mountains were continually coming into view. It
falls to the lot of few men to see land not previously looked
upon by human eyes, and it was with feelings of keen
curiosity and awe (mingled in my case with a fervent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">- 125 -</span>
hope that no land would block our path) that we watched
the new mountains rise from the great unknown that lay
before us.</p>

<p>No man of us could even guess what wonders might be
revealed to us in our march south, and our imaginations
took wings until a stumble in the snow or the sharp pangs
of hunger brought back our attention to the needs of
the immediate present.</p>

<p>Our anxiety, however, to learn what lay before us was
as keen as it could be, and the long days of marching
over the Barrier surface were saved from monotony by
the continued appearance of land to the south-east. As
we marched on and new mountains kept on rising, we
were concerned to notice that they trended more and
more to the eastward, for that meant that we must alter
our course from nearly due south. Nevertheless, we hoped
that when we reached them some strait might be found
which would enable us to go right through them and on
south. Really, however, patience was of more use to us
than speculation, for, come what might, we meant to
push on until our limit of strength was reached.</p>

<p>By November 28 we had reached a truly awful surface,
and poor Grisi, who had been smitten with snow-blindness,
had to be shot in the evening. Having made Depot C.
and left one week's provisions and oil to carry us back to
Depot B, we went on the next morning with 1200 lb.
weight, which we decided to pull with the ponies, but
we quickly discovered that the ponies would not pull
when we did, so we had to untoggle our harness.</p>

<p>The whole country seemed to be made up of range
upon range of mountains, but the surface over which we
were going was so bad that the ponies sank in right up
to their bellies, and we had to pull with might and main
to get the sledges to move.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">- 126 -</span></p>

<p>By evening the ponies were nearly played out, especially
old Quan, who was suffering, not from the weight of the
sledge, but from the effort of lifting his feet and limbs
through the soft snow, and on the following days we had
practically to pull his sledge.</p>

<p>The time had come for him to go, and I am sure that
we all felt losing him and I was especially sorry, as he
had been my special pony for several months. In spite
of all his annoying tricks, his immense intelligence made
him a general favourite.</p>

<span class="smaller">"THE HIGHWAY TO THE SOUTH"</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> December 1 we reached latitude 83Â° 16â€² south and
could see land stretching away to the east with a long
white line in front of it that looked like a giant barrier.
It seemed as though there was going to be a change
in some gigantic way in keeping with the vastness of our
surroundings.</p>

<p>At one moment our thoughts were on the grandeur
of the scene, the next on what we would have to eat if
we were let loose in a good restaurant. For we were very
hungry in these days, and lived mainly on pony-meat,
while on the march, to cool our throats as we pulled in
the hot sun, we chewed frozen meat.</p>

<p>The four of us had, now that Quan was gone, to haul
one sledge while Socks followed behind with the other,
and he soon got into our pace and did splendid work.
Although we were working only in shirts and pyjamas,
the sun beat down on our heads and we perspired freely,
whilst our feet were cold in the snow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">- 127 -</span></p>

<p>It was heavy work for us as the surface was as bad
as it could be, but soon after midday we got close enough
to see that ahead of us were enormous pressure ridges,
heavily crevassed and running a long way east, with not
the smallest chance of our being able to get southing that
way any longer on the Barrier. So we had to strike due
south in toward the land, and in the evening were close
to the ridges off the coast.</p>

<p>There was a red hill about 3000 ft. near to us which
we decided to go up on the following day, so that we
could gain a view of the surrounding country. How
anxious a time this was for us I need hardly mention,
for time was precious and food more so, and unless we
could find a good route through the mountains our way
to the Pole was well-nigh blocked.</p>

<p>Accordingly after breakfast we started off, leaving all
camp gear standing and a good feed by Socks to last
him for the day. Our allowance for lunch was four biscuits,
four lumps of sugar, and two ounces of chocolate each,
and we hoped to get water at the first of the rocks when
we landed.</p>

<p>Hardly had we gone one hundred yards when we came
to a crevasse, and, finding it difficult to see clearly with
my goggles, I took them off, and in consequence was
afterwards attacked by snow-blindness.</p>

<p>Several crevasses were successfully crossed, and then
we were brought up standing by an enormous chasm of
about 80 ft. wide and 300 ft. deep which lay across our
route. By going round to the right we found that this
chasm gradually became filled with snow, and so we
were able to cross and resume our line to the land, which
deceptively appeared quite close but was really miles
away.</p>

<p>Crossing several more crevasses, we reached about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">- 128 -</span>
midday an area of smooth blue ice where we obtained a
drink of delicious water, and after travelling for half a
mile we got to the base of the mountain which we hoped
to climb so that we might view the country. At 1 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>
we had a couple of biscuits, and then started to make our
way up the steep rock-face.</p>

<p>This was the most difficult part of the whole climb, for
the granite was weathered and split in every direction,
but at last we clambered up this face, and finally gained
the top of a ridge from which an open road to the south
burst upon our view. For running almost north and
south between two huge mountain ranges a great glacier
stretched before us.</p>

<p>Eagerly we clambered on to the top of the mountain,
and from the summit we could see the glacier stretching
away south inland until at last it seemed to disappear
in high inland ice. This was what we had seen ahead of
us and speculated about so freely.</p>

<p>There was no longer any question as to the way which
we should go, for though on the glacier we might meet
crevasses and difficulties not to be met with on the
Barrier, yet on the latter we could get no farther than
86Â° south, and then would have to turn in towards the
land and get over the mountains before we could reach
the Pole.</p>

<p>Our main difficulty on the glacier route would be, we
thought, with Socks, for as yet we could not hope to
drag the full load ourselves without relay work. All the
afternoon of December 4 we toiled at the sledge while
Socks pulled his load with ease, and eventually we reached
the head of the pass, 2000 ft. above sea-level.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">- 130 -</span></p>

<p>From that point there was a gentle descent towards
the glacier, and we camped for the night close to some
blue ice with granite boulders embedded in it, round
which, were pools of water. This last fact may seem
unimportant, but it was really of consequence to us as
this water saved our oil, for we had not to melt snow or
ice.</p>

<p>The pass through which we had come was flanked by
great granite pillars at least 2000 ft. in height, and which
made a magnificent entrance to the "Highway to the
South."</p>

<span class="smaller">ON THE GREAT GLACIER</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> morning of December 5 saw us breaking camp at
eight o'clock, and proceeding south down an icy slope
to the main glacier. Soon, however, the ice slope gave
place to a snow slope, and after a time the snow was
replaced by blue ice split by so many cracks and crevasses
that it was impossible for Socks to continue to drag the
sledge without our risking his life in one of the many
holes.</p>

<p>Snow-blindness was still troubling me so much that
I stayed in camp after lunch was over, while Marshall
and Adams went on to spy out a good route for us to
follow. They found that there was more cracked-up
blue ice ahead of us, andâ€”what was much more remarkableâ€”they
also discovered a bird, brown in colour with
a white line under each wing, which had flown just over
their heads and had disappeared to the south.</p>

<p>Such an incident was wonderfully strange in latitude
83Â° 40â€² south, and what this bird was I am unable to say,
for both Adams and Marshall were sure that it was not a
skua-gull, which was the only bird I could imagine
venturing so far south.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">- 131 -</span></p>

<p>Our camp for that night was pitched under a wonderful
pillar of granite, and as pieces of granite, from the size
of a hazel-nut to great boulders weighing thirty tons or
more, were lying all around, we felt that at any moment
a great piece of rock might come hurtling upon us. On
one snow slope, indeed, we could see the fresh track of
a fallen rock, but as it was impossible to spread a tent
on the blue ice we were compelled to camp, for half a
mile of crevassed ice lay between us and the snow slope
to the south-south-west, and we were too tired to march
any farther.</p>

<p>We left a depot at this spot, and then, refreshed by
sleep, we divided up our load and managed to get the
whole lot over the crevasses in three journeys.</p>

<p>But it was an awful job, for every step was a venture,
and one felt that at any moment our journey towards
the Pole might come to a permanent close. Having,
however, succeeded in crossing this particularly dangerous
half-mile, my companions (leaving me to rest with one
eye entirely blocked up by snow-blindness) went back
for Socks, and early in the afternoon we were once more
camped upon snow. During the rest of that day we had
a wonderful view of the mountains which rose up in
peaks and ranges, but the going was exceedingly heavy
and our progress was consequently very slow.</p>

<p>He, however, who hopes to go into the unexplored spots
of the world must harden himself to labour, and find
causes for cheerfulness in conditions which are at the
best only comparatively cheering. For instance, on the
following afternoon we were congratulating ourselves
that if the crevasses were as frequent as ever, the light,
at any rate, was better than it had been during the
morning, when suddenly we heard a shout of "Help"
from Wild, who was following us with Socks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">- 132 -</span></p>

<p>Stopping immediately, we rushed to his assistance,
and saw the pony sledge with the forward end down a
crevasse, and Wild reaching out from the side of the
gulf and hanging on to the sledge. There was no sign
whatever of Socks, and Wild's escape was simply miraculous.</p>

<p>He had been following our tracks, which passed over
a crevasse entirely covered with snow, when the weight
of the pony had broken through the snow crust and in
a second all was over. Wild told us that he felt a sort of
rushing wind, that the leading rope was snatched from
his hand, and that he put out his arms and just caught
the further edge of the chasm.</p>

<p>Fortunately for Wild and for us, Socks's weight snapped
the swingle-tree of the sledge, so it was saved though
the upper bearer was broken.</p>

<p>We lay down on our stomachs and looked into the gulf,
but no sound or sign came to us; we seemed to be gazing
down into a black bottomless pit.</p>

<p>Poor Socks was gone beyond recall, but if ever men
had cause for gratitude we had in Wild's escape, and in
the saving of the sledge. If the sledge had gone we should
have been left with only two sleeping-bags for the four
of us, and with such a short equipment we could scarcely
have even got back to winter quarters. As it was, the loss
of Socks was a most serious loss to us, because we had
counted upon his meat, but all we could do was to take
on the maize so that we could eat it ourselves.</p>

<p>Crevasses and pits of unknown depth continued to
beset us, and with 250 lb. per man to haul we naturally
could not march at any great rate; indeed, our anxiety
to find a level and inland ice-sheet, so that we could
increase our speed, was terrific.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">- 134 -</span></p>

<p>Falls, bruises, cut shins, crevasses, razor-edged ice,
and heavy upward pulls were the sum of our days' trials,
not interesting subjects for conversation when the night
found us in camp; but, as a matter of fact, our talk was
mainly about food and the things we would like to eat.
To show how hungry we were, I have only to mention
that by December 9 we were all looking forward to
Christmas Day, for then, whatever happened, we were
resolved to be full of food. On the tenth, after a day's
strenuous fight with the glacier, we camped under a
mountain which we named the "Cloud-Maker," and
ground up the balance of the maize between flat stones,
so that we might use it to eke out our supply of food.</p>

<p>The method of preparation was as primitive as the
food would have been unpalatable to most people, but
it was the only way we could make the maize fit to cook
without using more oil than we could spare for lengthy
boiling.</p>

<p>Critical as our position was, we were cheered by the
thought that we were still getting south, but the sledges
were being badly damaged by the continual ice-work,
and as there were still 340 geographical miles between
us and the Pole, we longed for a surface which was a
little less like walking over a cucumber-frame. Of all
the surfaces on which to travel, none can be more irritating
than that of rotten ice through which one's feet
are everlastingly breaking.</p>

<p>On such a surface, however, we could make a certain
amount of progress, and it was not until December 12
that we met with conditions which reduced our progress
for the day to a miserable three miles. Sharp-edge blue
ice full of chasms and crevasses, and rising to hills and
sinking into gullies, provided us with obstacles unequalled
in any polar work for difficulty in travelling. Under such
circumstances we had to have recourse to relay work,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">- 135 -</span>
for we could only take on one sledge at a time, two of us
pulling while the others steadied and held the sledge
to keep it straight. In this way we advanced for a mile,
and then returned over the crevasses and hauled up the
other sledges over a surface where often and often a slip
meant death.</p>

<p>In such rough-and-tumble work the sledges naturally
suffered, and the one with the broken bow frequently
striking against hard, sharp ice, pulled us up with a jerk
and flung us down. In all our difficulties and dangers,
however, we found solace in the thought that the glacier
must eventually end and our longed-for plateau be
reached.</p>

<p>By December 16 we had crossed nearly one hundred
miles of crevassed ice and risen 6000 ft. on the largest
glacier in the world, and on the following afternoon we
burned our boats behind us as regards warm clothing,
and made a depot of everything except the barest necessities.
But relay work still hampered our progress towards
our goal, and no thirsty man ever longed for water with
more eagerness than we longed for the plateau and the
end of that vast glacier.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Never</span> do I expect to meet anything more tantalising
than the plateau on which our hopes were set. By
December 18 I thought that we were almost up, and yet
we had to go on and on, apparently unable to get rid
of the crevasses.</p>

<p>By this time we were fully conscious that food was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">- 136 -</span>
to be the key to our success or failure to reach the Pole,
and we began to save food in order to spin it out, a saving
which made us almost ravenous with hunger. Each day
we saved two biscuits per man, and also some pemmican
and sugar, and we tried to satisfy our hunger by eating
pony maize, which we soaked in water to make it less
hard. If only dreams prevented one from hunger we
should have been well off, for each night we all dreamed
of foods.</p>

<p>A week before Christmas we had food for thirty-five
days, and were about three hundred geographical miles
from the Pole, with the same distance back to the depot
we had just made, so that at the best we knew that we
must march on short rations if we were to reach our goal.</p>

<p>Each succeeding day we hoped to get rid of the crevasses,
but although we were fortunate in having been
favoured with splendid weather, we had to camp each
night sustained by the hope that on the morrow we
should really be upon the plateau, and by the thought
that Christmas Dayâ€”with its splendid dinnerâ€”was
approaching.</p>

<p>By December 21â€”Midsummer Dayâ€”the weather had
changed, and we encountered 28Â° of frost and such
a strong blizzard wind that both our fingers and our ears
were frost-bitten, while our beards were masses of ice
all day long. From the conditions I could easily imagine
that we were on a spring sledging journey, for such a
chilly wind was blowing that it found its way through
the nearly worn-out walls of our tent.</p>

<p>Relay work still continued to hamper us, and on the
22nd we had to work with the alpine rope all day, dragging
400 lb. at a time up steep slopes and across ridges,
and roping ourselves together when we went back for
the second sledge, because the ground was so treacherous
that often we were only saved by the rope from falling
into fathomless pits.</p>

<p>Wild described this sensation of walking over a surface
of half-ice and half-snow as like walking over the glass
roof of a station, and so accustomed did we become to
crevasses that our usual question when any of us fell
into one was, "Have you found it?"</p>

<p>I suppose that we became callous as regards immediate
dangers, though I confess that we were always glad to
meet crevasses with their coats off, that is, not hidden
by their perilous snow-coverings. Longing as we were
really to stretch out our legs for the Pole, it can easily
be imagined how irksome this constant succession of
crevasses was. And to add to our discomforts, the temperature
had become so low that the pony-maize refused
any longer to swell in the water, the result being that it
swelled after we had eaten it.</p>

<p>Christmas Eve, however, brought a change in our
fortunes, and was much the brightest day we had enjoyed
since entering our southern gateway. We covered over
eleven miles, and at night were 9095 ft. above sea-level,
and the way before us was still rising.</p>

<p>So far we had seen no sign of the very hard surface
that Captain Scott speaks of in connection with his
journey on the Northern Plateau, but we were determined
not to give up hopes of better surfaces, for without them
we knew that we should not reach the Pole. As Christmas
approached our thoughts naturally turned to home and
the festivities and joys of the time. How greatly we
longed to hear "the hansoms slurring through the London
mud" it is impossible to say. But instead of the sights
and sounds of London we were lying in a little tent,
isolated high on the roof of the end of the world, far
indeed from the trodden paths of men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">- 139 -</span></p>

<p>Nevertheless our thoughts flew across the wastes of
snow and ice, and across the oceans to those for whom
we were striving, and who, we knew, were thinking of
us.</p>

<p>By noon on Christmas Day we had by hard hauling
covered over five miles, and had reached a latitude of
85Â° 51â€² south. Then I took a photograph of the camp
with the Queen's flag flying and also our tent flags, my
companions being in the picture, and in the evening we
had a splendid dinner, the details of which I cannot
refrain from giving.</p>

<p>First came "hoosh," consisting of pony ration boiled up
with pemmican and some of our emergency Oxo and
biscuit. Then in the cocoa-water I boiled our little
plum pudding, which a friend of Wild's had given him.
This, with a drop of medical brandy, was a luxury which
the greatest glutton living might have envied. And
afterwards came cocoa; and, lastly, cigars and a spoonful
of liqueur sent us by a friend in Scotland.</p>

<p>We were really satisfied for once, and as we knew that
we should not be in that happy state again for many a
long day, we discussed the situation after dinner and
decided still further to reduce our food.</p>

<p>On Christmas Day we were nearly 250 geographical
miles from the Pole, and having one month's food but
only three weeks' biscuit, we resolved to make each
week's food last ten days, and to throw away everything
except the most absolute necessities.</p>

<p>Already we were as regards clothes down to the limit,
but at this time we decided also to dump a lot of spare
gearâ€”and risk it.</p>

<p>Pulling 150 lb. per man, we spent our Boxing Day
among ridges and crevasses. Every time we reached the
top of a ridge we said to ourselves, "Perhaps this is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">- 140 -</span>
last," but the last was long in coming. And in the meantime
our maize was nearly finished, and our rations were
bound to be shorter than ever. Considering that hard
half-cooked maize gave us indigestion, it is, perhaps,
curious that we were very sorry that there was so little
of it left, but those who have suffered from both hunger
and indigestion know too well which is the harder to
endure.</p>

<p>On December 28 we reached 10,199 ft. above sea-level
and a latitude of 86Â° 31', and bad headachesâ€”which
were, I think, a form of mountain sicknessâ€”began to
attack us. The sensation was as though the nerves were
being twisted up with a corkscrew and then pulled out.
Our sledge was by this time badly strained, and on the
dreadful bad surface of soft snow was very hard to move;
and when it is remembered that physical labour of any
kind is always trying at a great height, it is not to be
wondered at that we were beginning to feel nearly spent.</p>

<p>If the rise would only have stopped we could have
endured the cold, but the two together were terribly
trying; and then, to add to our unhappiness, the last
day but one of the old year brought with it such a blizzard
from the south that we had to spend nearly the whole of
it in our sleeping-bags.</p>

<p>There we lay while precious time and food were going,
and tried to think how we could improve the situation,
but all we could find to console us was the resolution
that if we could get near enough to the Pole to rush for
it, we would leave almost everything behind us and make
the attempt. The last day of the year brought us eleven
miles nearer to our goal, and although our heads were
aching and the shortness of food was telling on us terribly,
we were, in spite of everything, cheered by the thought
that we were still <i>getting south</i>.</p>

<span class="smaller">FARTHEST SOUTH</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">By</span> the evening of New Year's Day we were within
172Â½ miles of the Pole, so we had managed to beat all
records North and South, and we also had hopes of a better
surfaceâ€”which were, unfortunately, not fulfilled. Again
we had to battle over very soft snow, and the cold wind
seemed to go right through us, weakened as we were
from want of food.</p>

<p>Impossible as it was to think of failure yet, I compelled
myself to look at the matter sensibly and to consider the
lives of those who were with me. I felt indeed that if
we went on too far it would be impossible to get back
over such a surface, and then all the results of our efforts
would be lost to the world.</p>

<p>We had now definitely located the South Pole on the
highest plateau in the world, and our geological and
meteorological work would be of the greatest use to
science. But all this was not the Pole. And how sadly
I realised that I need not say.</p>

<p>Still, man could only do his best, and after ten hours'
struggle against the strongest forces of nature, one pannikin
of food with two biscuits and a cup of cocoa did
but little to warm and comfort and satisfy him.</p>

<p>I resolved to make a depot on the 4th and then to
dash for the Pole, and on that day we left a depot on the
great wide plateau, a risk which nothing but the circumstances
could justify, but to which my companions agreed
with the regardlessness of self which they had always
shown.</p>

<p>Pathetically small did the bamboo look which we left
to mark the little stock of provisionsâ€”indeed, we lost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">- 143 -</span>
sight of it in half an hour, and had to trust that our
footprints in the snow would guide us back again to the
depot.</p>

<p>By night, however, I knewâ€”and had to acknowledgeâ€”that
our limit was almost reached. We had only been
carrying 70 lb. per man since we had made our last
depot, but it was harder work than the 100 odd lb. we
had been pulling the day before, and far harder than
250 lb. had seemed some three weeks previously.</p>

<p>Nothing could more clearly have convinced me of our
failing strength, even if I could have shut my eyes to the
facts that our faces were cut, our feet and hands always
on the verge of frost-bite, our boots nearly worn out,
and that when we got up in the morning out of the wet
bag, our Burberries became immediately like a coat of
mail, and also that our heads and beards got iced up
with the moisture when breathing on the march.</p>

<p>What we would have given at that time for a pair of
scissors to trim our beards I should not like to say, and
had we known that we were going to experience such
cold weather we should certainly have kept a pair.</p>

<p>The main things, indeed, against us were the altitude
and ice-cold wind. Nature had declared against us, and
at the best I had to abandon all hopes of getting nearer
than 100 geographical miles to the Pole.</p>

<p>During the next day we were absolutely obliged to
increase our food if we were to get on at all, for our
temperatures were far below normal, and I had such a
headache that I should be sorry for any living man who
had to endure such pain.</p>

<p>Never once had the thermometer been above zero
since we had been on to the plateau, though this was the
height of summer, and on January 6 we had to endure
57Â° of frost with a strong blizzard and high drift.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">- 144 -</span></p>

<p>Still, helped by the bigger rationsâ€”which did not
amount to anything approaching full rationsâ€”we marched
thirteen and a quarter geographical miles and reached
88Â° 7â€² south. But at night I had to admit that this must
be our last outward march, though I determined that
we would make one more rush south with the flag. With
what feelings of sadness I came to this decision I cannot
even try to describe. Only one thing softened our grievous
disappointment, and that was the conviction that we
had striven to the very limit of our strength, and had not
given in until the forces of nature combined with our
scanty supply of food had conquered us.</p>

<p>Two days, however, had to be passed in our bags before
we could make the final dash with the flag, days of
shrieking blizzard and piercing cold, days in which our
valuable food was going without our marching, and in
which we had a gloomy foreboding that our tracks, to
which we were trusting mainly to find our depot, might
drift up.</p>

<p>Truly we realised that we had taken a most serious
risk, and that we were in a most critical situation, but
we were partly sustained by the fact that, at any rate,
we had played the game to the last and utmost.</p>

<p>With 72Â° of frost the wind cut searchingly into our
thin tent, and even the drift found its way on to our
bags, which were wet enough already. Cramp kept on
attacking us, and every now and then a frozen foot had
to be nursed into life again by placing it inside the shirt
and next to the skin of the sufferer's almost as suffering
neighbour. To add to our dreariness we had nothing to
read, as we had depoted our little books so that we
might save weight.</p>

<p>We had honestly and truly shot our bolt at last, and
when the wind dropped about midnight we were soon up
and ready to struggle forward a little further and hoist
the flag as near to the South Pole as we could possibly
bear it.</p>

<p>At 9 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on January 9 we were in latitude 88Â° 23'
south, longitude 162Â° east, half running and half walking
over a surface much hardened by the recent blizzard,
and it was indeed strange to us to go along without the
nightmare of that heavy sledge dragging behind us.</p>

<p>Soon the time came when we had to hoist Her Majesty's
flag and afterwards the other Union Jack, and then we
took possession of the plateau in the name of His Majesty.
And while the Union Jack blew out stiff in the icy gale
which was still cutting us to the bone, we looked south
with our powerful glasses, but could see nothing but the
dead white snow plain.</p>

<p>No break in the plateau was to be seen as it extended
toward the Pole, and we felt absolutely sure that the
goal which we had struggled forâ€”and failed to reachâ€”lay
on this plain.</p>

<p>We stayed only for a few minutes, and then, taking
the Queen's flag with us, we turned our backs upon the
Pole and began to retrace our steps. Regretfully it is
true, but conscious that, though failure was ours, we had
done our best to avoid it.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE RETURN MARCH</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> homeward marches are a tale of sufferings from
hunger and dysentery, of struggles against blizzards and
crevasses and bad surfaces. One desire drove us on from
depot to depot, and that was our supreme craving for
food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">- 147 -</span></p>

<p>All of us had tragic dreams of getting food to eat, but
rarely did we have the satisfaction of dreaming that we
were actually eating. I did, however, once have a dream
that I was eating bread and butter. Conscience is said
to make men cowardly, and I am sure that it is as true
to say that hunger makes them very peevish and irritable.
We looked at each other as we ate our scanty meals, and
felt a distinct grievance if one man managed to make
his ration last longer than the rest of us. Sometimes
we did our best to save a bit of biscuit for the next meal,
but the problem whether it was better to eat the food at
once or to keep a fragment to nibble afterwards was
never solved.</p>

<p>At the start circumstances may be said to have favoured
us, for we picked up the depot which we had ventured
to leave on the great white plain, and the wind was so
strongly behind that we were able to put the sail on the
sledge.</p>

<p>In five days we had knocked off some eighty-six
geographical miles of those which separated us from our
home, and as we were left with only six days' biscuit on
short ration and had to go 120 more miles before we
reached our next depot, we decided to cut down our
food by another biscuit.</p>

<p>A following wind continued to help us, and the sail was
of such assistance that on one day we made a record of
twenty-six and a half miles, and beat it on the next by
doing twenty-nine miles.</p>

<p>But although to beat records is pleasant under any
circumstances, my own pleasure was rather diminished
by the facts that my heels were frost-bitten and cracked,
and that there were also cracks under some of my toes.</p>

<p>We had, however, struggled on until we were within
eight and a half miles of our depot, though had we been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">- 148 -</span>
hindered instead of helped by the strong blizzard wind,
it is no exaggeration to say that our chance of escaping
starvation would have been inexpressibly small.</p>

<p>On the 20th we reached our depot at 12.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> with
sore and aching bodies, and after a struggle against
countless difficulties. For two hours we descended a
snow-slope, with heavy sastrugi, and then we struck
half a mile of badly crevassed <i>nÃ©vÃ©</i>. After that we got on
to blue slippery ice, where we could obtain no foothold,
and to add to the discomfort and danger of the situation,
a gale was blowing which swept the sledge sideways and
knocked us off our feet.</p>

<p>All of us had heavy falls, and I had two very heavy
ones which shook me severely. On several occasions one
or more of us lost our footing and were swept by the wind
down the ice-slope, only with the greatest difficulty
getting back to our sledge and companions.</p>

<p>Bad, however, as that day was, and perilous as was
our position, we had said a glad farewell to that awful
plateau, and were on our way down the glacier.</p>

<p>On the next day I harnessed up for a while, but so
bruised and battered was I by my falls that I soon had
to give up pulling and to content myself by walking by
the sledge. Fortunately we had a fair wind and a downhill
course, so my inability to pull was not an important
matter.</p>

<p>The 24th saw us with only two days' food left and one
day's biscuit on much reduced ration, and we had to
cover forty miles of crevasses before we could reach our
next depot. Crevassed ice still added terribly to our
troubles, but though weak I had almost recovered from
my falls.</p>

<p>Continually we seemed to be fighting for the same
thing, to struggle on from one depot to the next to save
ourselves from starvation. A lunch of a cup of tea, two
biscuits, and two spoonsful of cheese does not make one
exactly buoyant to attack the march of the afternoon,
but by the 25th we were reduced to this, and at night
the food, with the exception of one meal, was completely
gone.</p>

<p>No biscuit was left, and all we had to sustain us was
cocoa, tea, salt and pepper, and very little of these. On
that night we were very tired indeed, and we knew that
it was absolutely necessary for us to reach our depot
on the following day. By 7 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on the 26th we came to
the end of all our provisions except a little tea and cocoa,
and that day and the following one can never be erased
from our memories, for they were the hardest and the
most trying that any of us had ever spent in our
lives.</p>

<p>From 7 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on the 26th till 2 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> on the 27th we did
sixteen miles over the worst surfaces and most dangerous
crevasses we had encountered, only stopping for tea and
cocoa till they were finished, and marching twenty hours
at a stretch through snow 10 to 18 in. thick as a rule,
with sometimes 2Â½ ft. of it. Often and often we fell
into hidden crevasses, and were only saved by each other
and by our harness. No words of mine could bring
before you the mental and physical strain of those forty-eight
hours. I will only say that had not an all-merciful
Providence guided our steps we could never have arrived
safely at the depot.</p>

<p>When we started at 7 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on the 26th we had no
biscuit left, and with only one pannikin of hoosh, mostly
pony-maize, and one of tea, we marched till noon. Then
we had another pannikin of tea and one ounce of chocolate
and marched till 4.45 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> Having no food, we then
had another pannikin of tea and marched until 10 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">- 151 -</span>
when we had one small pannikin of cocoa. On again
after that until 2 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, when we were utterly played out
and slept until 8 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> Then we had a pannikin of cocoa
and marched until 1 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, when we camped about half
a mile from our depot.</p>

<p>Both Adams and Wild had fallen exhausted in their
harness, but had recovered and gone on again. Marshall
went on to the depot for food, and at 2 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> we got the
meal we so desperately needed. And after this very
near call we turned in and slept, thankful indeed to have
escaped so far with our lives.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> last we were on the Barrier again, and with six days'
food and only fifty miles between us and our next supply
I thought that grave danger was behind us. But the man
who congratulates himself that anxieties and perils are
over, before he has reached the very end of his polar
exploration work is wasting his time.</p>

<p>In our case Wild developed dysentery, the cause of
which we could only ascribe to the horse-meat; while
just before we left the glacier I broke through some soft
snow and plunged into a hidden crevasse. The harness
jerked up under my heart, and it seemed as though the
glacier were saying, "There is the last touch for you;
don't you come up here again!"</p>

<p>Certainly we were as tired of that glacier as it apparently
was of us, and our joy at leaving it was tremendous;
for although the Barrier gave us a most unfriendly
greeting, we knew that a great many dangers were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">- 152 -</span>
over, and thought that nothing except blizzards and
thick weather were to be feared.</p>

<p>The Barrier, however, did not mean to be beaten by
the glacier in the way of treating us harshly, for during
our first day on it we were attacked by a wind which
froze solidly all our wet clothes, and five minutes after
the wind had sprung up we were struck by a furious
blizzard of snow and heavy drift. Under the circumstances
we had to pitch our camp, and He in our bags,
patching our worn-out clothesâ€”a rather tedious, if
useful, pursuit when one was literally aching to go on.</p>

<p>During the following days there was a variety in
our misfortunesâ€”a variety, indeed, which was so terribly
weakening that by the beginning of February our outlook
had become more serious than it had ever been.</p>

<p>Dysentery had attacked all of us acutely; but if
there was a variety in our troubles, there was none in
our food, for we had only four miserably thin biscuits
a day to eke out our horse-meat.</p>

<p>On February 2 we reached our next depot, and
started on the following day with a new sledge and
150 lb. more weight. But on that day all of us were
suffering from dysentery, and Wild was very bad indeed.</p>

<p>On the 4th I wrote in my diary, "Cannot write more.
All down with acute dysentery; terrible day. No march
possible; outlook serious. Fine weather."</p>

<p>It gives me joy now to think that, anxious and spent
as we were, trusting indeed to God to pull us through,
but too weary and weak to be very hopeful or to care
very much, we still hung on to the geological specimens
we had collected.</p>

<p>By the 6th we were all better, but we were terribly
hungry, and six biscuits per day and one pannikin of
horse-meat each meal did nothing to enable us to regain
our strength. Indeed, my fear was that this incessant
hunger would weaken us so much that our return would
never be accomplished.</p>

<p>On the 7th Adams and Marshall were again attacked
by dysentery; and, though Wild and I were free of it,
all of us were pitiably weak. Still we struggled on,
starving for food, and talking about it all the time as we
advanced slowly towards the north.</p>

<p>The mounds which we had laid on our way out continued
to guide us on our return, and were a great comfort,
but all our thoughts and our conversation were about
food. Wind and weather helped us through that desperate
time, or again in our weakened and starving condition
we could never have hoped to reach our next depot.</p>

<p>Assisted, however, as we were, we reached the depot
on February 13 without a single particle of food left.
There we found poor old Chinaman's liver, and thought
it a dish that kings might envy. We looked round for
any spare bits of meat, and while I was digging in the
snow I came across some hard red stuff, which turned
out to be Chinaman's blood frozen into a solid core.
We dug it up, and in such straits were we that we found
it a most welcome addition to our food. When boiled
up, it seemed to us like beef-tea.</p>

<p>Truly I was in luck in those days, for the fifteenth of
February was my birthday, and I was given a present
of a cigarette made out of pipe tobacco and some paper
we had with us. It tasted absolutely delicious.</p>

<p>Those, however, were glad moments in a most distressing
time, for on the day following my smoke all of
us were again so appallingly hungry, and consequently
so weak, that even to lift our almost empty provision-bag
was an effort.</p>

<p>When we broke camp in the morning we pulled the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">- 155 -</span>
tent off the poles and took it down before we moved
the things inside, for the effort of lifting anything through
the doorway was too much for us. At night we sometimes
had to lift our legs one at a time with both hands
in getting them into the tent, and after we had stiffened
from the day's march it seemed almost impossible to
lift our feet without assistance.</p>

<p>On the 17th we had to march in a blinding blizzard,
with 42Â° of frost, but mercifully the wind was behind
us; and although the sledge with the sail up sometimes
overran us and sometimes, getting into a patch of soft
snow, brought us up with a jerk, we were thankful that
we had not to face such a wind. The jerks, however,
were very painful; for when we were brought up
suddenly, the harness round our weakened stomachs
hurt us very much indeed.</p>

<p>All of us had tragic dreams of getting food to eat,
and with four men as hungry as we were, I can assure
you that it saves much envy if all of them finish their
meal at precisely the same moment. The man in our
party who managed to make his hoosh last longer than
the rest of us was not for the time being at all a popular
man.</p>

<p>On the 18th we sighted Mount Discovery, and it seemed
to be a connecting link between us and our winter
quarters. Its big, bluff form showed out in the north-west,
and we felt that this same mountain might at the
very moment be drawing the eyes of our own people.
It looked like a reminder that there was still a place
called "home," and helped to cheer us on our painful
way.</p>

<p>Mount Erebus was sighted on the following morning,
and if we had not come to the end of our supplies again,
except for some scraps of meat scraped off the bones of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">- 156 -</span>
Grisi after they had been lying on the snow and in the
sun for months, all would have been well. To eat these
however, was too great a risk until we were faced with
absolute and complete starvation, and on the following day
we hoped to reach Depot A.</p>

<p>Calls to breakfast had long since been things of the
past. The cook of the day no longer said, "Come on
boys; good hoosh," for no good hoosh was to be had
and in less time than it has taken me to write this out
food was finished, and then our hopes and thought
lay wholly in the direction of the next feed, so called
from force of habit.</p>

<p>On the 20th we were impeded by such a bad light
that we could only see a little way; but by 4 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> we
reached Depot A, at which was the tin of jam that we
had originally intended to eat on Christmas Dayâ€”and
never did jam taste more delightful! Our depoted
tobacco and cigarettes were also there, and apart from
the intense enjoyment of a good smoke, I felt sure that
tobacco would make up for the shortage of food until
we reached the Bluff depot. This last depot was the one
which I had told Joyce to lay out, and which was the one
ray of hope in front of us during these days of hunger
and disease.</p>

<p>At any rate, we had to stake upon finding provisions
at the Bluff, for we had not food enough to carry us back
to the ship. In fact, if we did not find it we were lost men
Each time we took in another hole in our belts we said
that everything would be all right as soon as the Bluff
was reached, and so eager were we to reach the good
things in store for us that on the 21st we struggled on
through a blizzard with as many as 67Â° of frost.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">- 158 -</span></p>

<p>In ordinary polar work no one would think of travelling
in such weather, but our need was extreme and we had
to keep on going. Food lay ahead and death stalked us
from behind. We were so thin that our bones ached as
we lay on the hard snow in our sleeping-bags. Was it to
be wondered at that, blizzard or no blizzard, we were
determined to struggle forward until we dropped?</p>

<p>And on the 22nd we had a splendid day, and came
across the tracks of men with dogs, which assured us
that the depot had been laid all right. Soon afterwards
we passed their noon camp, and as tins were lying round
which had different brands from those of the original
stores, we were certain also that the ship had returned.</p>

<p>After carefully searching the ground for unconsidered
trifles, we found three small bits of chocolate and a tiny
bit of biscuit, and we "turned backs" for them. I was
unlucky enough to get the biscuit, and a curious and
unreasoning anger took possession of me for a moment
at my bad luck. Nothing could show more strikingly
how primitive we had become, and how much the question
of even a morsel of food affected our judgment.</p>

<p>However, we were near to the Bluff, but though we
felt certain that food was going to be there in plenty, we
also were occasionally beset by the thought that if by
some chance it was not, then all chance of our safety was
at an end.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE FINAL STAGE</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Early</span> on the morning of the 23rd we broke camp, and
in a few hours Wild saw the Bluff depot miraged up. It
seemed to be quite close, and the flags were waving
and dancing, as though to say, "Come, here I am;
come and feed!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">- 159 -</span></p>

<p>It was indeed a cheerful sight for weary and hungry
men, and directly we saw it we devoured the few biscuits
we still possessed.</p>

<p>At 4 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> we reached this haven, and found that
Joyce and his party had done their work splendidly;
and I, climbing to the top of it, told those below of the
glorious feeds awaiting us. Luxuries there were in plenty:
Carlsbad plums, cakes, eggs, plum puddings, and even
fresh boiled mutton from the ship. Apart, however,
from these luxuries there was an ample supply of ordinary
sledging rations, so that we were safe from a want of
food, and had only to get back to the ship.</p>

<p>With what thankfulness we set upon our provisions
those who have not suffered from want and hunger
cannot imagine. Suddenly we found ourselves with
meals fit for the gods, and with appetites that the gods
might have envied. Our contracted bodies, however,
would not stand the strain of much food, but I cannot
express the relief it was to know that we had only to
stretch our hands to touch food, even if we could not
eat it. I lay writing in my bag that night with biscuits
and chocolate and jam beside me. I dare say this reminds
the reader of a greedy schoolboy; but it is true, and I
see no reason to think that it was anything but perfectly
natural.</p>

<p>At the Bluff we did not receive much news of the
<i>Nimrod</i>, except that Evans, who had towed us down
in the <i>Koonya</i>, was now in command of it; and we
heard nothing of either the northern or the western
party.</p>

<p>Now our main object was to get back to the ship
before she was compelled to sail, and full of hope we
proceeded on our way during the 24th.</p>

<p>On the following day, however, Marshall was attacked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">- 160 -</span>
by paralysis of the stomach and renewed dysentery,
and as a blizzard was blowing we decided to lie in our
bags and wait. These misfortunes were particularly
distressing, for it was absolutely necessary to push on
if we were to catch the <i>Nimrod</i>. According to orders,
the ship might very possibly leave on March 1 if the
Sound was not clear of ice, and we had already arrived
at February 26 in a year which unhappily was not Leap
Year.</p>

<p>On the 26th we did manage to do twenty-four miles,
but although Marshall never complained, he suffered
severely, and as his dysentery was getting worse and
worse, I decided, on the afternoon of the 27th, to leave
him in the care of Adams, and to push ahead with
Wild.</p>

<p>My hope was that we should pick up a relief party at
the ship, and so we hurried on with no sleep and with
the briefest stoppages for meals, until we had been
marching for nearly twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>By this time our food was finished, and naturally we
were very tired, but although we kept on flashing the
heliograph in the hope of attracting attention from
Observation Hill, where I thought a party would be' on
the look-out, there was no return flash.</p>

<p>Still, there was nothing to do except to push ahead,
and once we thought that we saw a party coming over
to meet us, but to our sorrow the "party" turned out
to be a group of penguins at the ice edge.</p>

<p>At 2.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> we sighted open water ahead, but the
weather had suddenly become so thick that it was
impossible to see far, and our arrival at the ice edge was
quite sudden and unexpected. The ice was swaying up
and down so warningly that to continue on that course
was to run grave risk of being carried out, so we decided
to follow another route, seven miles round by the other
side of Castle Rock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">- 161 -</span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">- 162 -</span></p>

<p>At last, after what seemed a never-ending struggle,
we reached Castle Rock, from whence we could see that
there was open water all round the north. Indeed, it
was a different home-coming from the one we had
anticipated.</p>

<p>Often on the Barrier and up on the plateau our
thoughts had turned to the day when we should return
to winter quarters, but never had we imagined that we
should have to fight our way to the back door, so to
speak, in such a cheerless fashion.</p>

<p>At 7.45 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> we reached the top of Ski Slope, and from
there both the hut and the bay could be seen. But no
sign of the ship could we find, and no trace of life could
be seen at the hut.</p>

<p>With our minds full of gloomy possibilities, we hurried
on to the hut, and discovered that every one had gone
away.</p>

<p>A letter had been left for us stating that all the parties
had been picked up except ours, and that the ship would
be sheltering under Glacier Tongue until February 26.
As it was already February 28 there is no need to say
how distressed we were at this new development of the
situation. For if the ship was gone, both the plight of
the two men out on the Barrier and of ourselves was a
most serious one.</p>

<p>That was a bad night for Wild and myself, for although
we were able to have a good meal, we had left our
sleeping-bags behind, and had to wrap pieces of roofing-felt
round us in our attempts to keep warm. Our efforts
were neither successful in that direction nor in that of
trying to signal for help. For we could not get the
magnetic hut to light, and we were so tired and cold
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">- 163 -</span>
that when we endeavoured to tie up the Union Jack on
the hill the knots were too much for us.</p>

<p>In the morning, however, we managed to make both
of these signals, and all our fears vanished with one
glad swoop when we saw the ship in the distance.</p>

<p>At 11 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on March 1 we were once more on board
the <i>Nimrod</i>, and I will not attempt to describe the
load which was suddenly lifted from my shoulders, or
the reception we received from our friends who had
given us up for lost, and who on that same day were
going to send out a search-party in the hope of finding
some traces of us.</p>

<p>The ship brought us nothing but good news from the
outside world, and I found that every member of the
Expedition was well, and that the work laid down had
been accomplished.</p>

<p>The immediate thing, however, to do was not to
delay over these splendid reports, but to bring in Adams
and Marshall; and in the afternoon I started off again
from the Barrier edge with Mackay, Mawson and
McGillan, leaving Wild on the <i>Nimrod</i>.</p>

<p>We found that Marshall's health had been improved
by the rest, but the march renewed the attack,
and it was with feelings of great relief that we at
length got him back to winter quarters and put him to
bed.</p>

<p>By 1 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on March 4 we were all once more safe on
board the <i>Nimrod</i>; but Adams, after surviving all the
dangers of the interior of the Antarctic continent, was
nearly lost within sight of safety. Owing to the fact
that he was wearing new finnesko he slipped at the
ice edge, and only just managed to save himself from
going over, and to hang on until he was rescued
by a party from the ship. He had begun with a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">- 164 -</span>
painful accident and nearly finished with a fatal
one.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Southern Party were in safety once more, but how
often and often we were almost hopeless of ever making
our way back to the ship I cannot say. We had taken
our lives in our own hands, and God had preserved them.
Perils from starvation, disease, and sudden death had
surrounded us, and as we had learned to know what it
is to suffer and to endure, we had also learned what it
is to feel supremely grateful for mercy and for guidance.</p>

<span class="smaller">NOTES ON THE SOUTHERN JOURNEY</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> brought back with us from our march towards the
Pole vivid memories of how to feel intensely, fiercely
hungry.</p>

<p>From November 15, 1908, until February 23, 1909, we
had but one full meal on Christmas Day, and even then
scarcely any time had passed before we were as hungry
as ever. Our daily allowance of food would have been
a small one for a city worker in a temperate climate, and
in our own case hunger was increased by the fact that
we were performing vigorous labour in a very low temperature.</p>

<p>When our evening meal was prepared we used to
"turn backs" in order to ensure fair divisions of the food.
The cook used to pour the hoosh into pannikins and
arrange the biscuits in four heaps, and as soon as we were
all satisfied that the divisions were equal one man would
turn his back, and another, pointing at one lot, would say
"Whose?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">- 165 -</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="img_pg_165" style="width: 500px;">
  <img src="images/img_pg_165.png" width="500" height="375" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Southern Party on board the "Nimrod." Left to right: Wild, Shackleton,
Marshall, Adams.</span> (<i>See page 164</i>)</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">- 166 -</span></p>

<p>Then the man with his back turned would mention a
name, and so the distribution proceeded, each of us
feeling sure that the smallest share had fallen to
his lot.</p>

<p>On alternate days we had chocolate and cheese for
lunch, and since the former was more satisfying and
easier to divide we infinitely preferred it. Considering
how greatly we depended during our march upon pony-meat,
the reader will readily understand that the loss of
Socks was a terrible blow to us.</p>

<p>If we had been able to use poor Socks for food there
is no doubt that we should have been able to get further
south, and perhaps even have reached the Pole itself.
But I must also mention that had we managed to
get to the Pole, we could scarcely have caught the ship
before she was compelled to leave by the approach of
winter.</p>

<p>During the last weeks of the journey outwards, and
the long march back when our allowance had been
reduced to twenty ounces per man a day, I confess without
one atom of shame that we really thought of little
but food. Man becomes very primitive when he is
desperately hungry, and neither the glory of the
mountains that towered high on our sides, nor the majesty
of the great glacier up which we travelled so painfully,
appealed to any extent to our emotions.</p>

<p>I used often to find myself wondering whether people
who suffer from hunger in the big cities of civilisation felt
as we were feeling, and I concluded that they did not, for
no barrier of law and order would have been allowed to
stand between us and any food that had been available.
The difference must be that the man who starves in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">- 167 -</span>
city is weakened and hopeless and without spirit while
weâ€”until nearly the endâ€”were vigorous and keen.</p>

<p>We could not joke about food in any way that is possible
for the man who is hungry in the ordinary sense. True
we thought and talked about it most of the time, but
always in the most serious manner.</p>

<p>On the outward march we were not severely hungry
until we reached the great glacier, and then we were so
occupied with the dangers of climbing and of crossing
crevasses that we were unable to talk much. And afterwards
on the plateau our faces were generally so covered
with ice that unnecessary conversation was out of the
question.</p>

<p>It was on the march back, after we had got down the
glacier, and were tramping over the Barrier surface that
we talked freely of food. Strange feelings, indeed, did I
have when I looked back over our notes, and saw the
wonderful meals that we promised to eat when we could
get inside a really good restaurant.</p>

<p>We used to tell each other, with perfect seriousness,
about the new dishes that we had thought of, and if the
dish met with general approval there would be a chorus
of "Ah! That's good."</p>

<p>The "Wild roll" was admitted to be the high-water
mark of gastronomic luxury. He proposed that the
cook should take a supply of well-seasoned minced meat,
wrap it in rashers of fat bacon, and place around the
whole an outer covering of rich pastry so that it would
take the form of a big sausage-roll. Then this roll was
to be fried with plenty of fat.</p>

<p>My best dish, which I admit I put forward with a good
deal of pride as we marched over the snow, was a sardine
pasty. And I remember that one day Marshall came
forward with a proposal for a thick roll of suet pudding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">- 168 -</span>
with plenty of jam all over it, and there arose quite a
heated argument whether he could claim this dish to be
an invention, or whether it was not the jam roll already
known to the housewives of civilisation.</p>

<p>One point there was on which we were all agreed, and
that was our wish not to have any jellies or things of that
sort at our future meals. The idea of eating such slippery
stuff as jelly did not appeal in the least to any one of us.</p>

<p>Perhaps all this sounds very greedy and uncivilised
to anyone who has never been on the verge of starvation,
but I wish to say again that hunger makes a man primitive.
Not a smile broke from us as we planned wonderful
feats of over-eating, in truth we were intensely serious
about the matter, and we noted down in the back pages
of our diaries details of feasts we would have when we got
back to the land of plenty.</p>

<p>The dysentery from which we suffered was certainly
due to the meat from the pony Grisi. This animal was
shot when greatly fatigued, and I think that his flesh was
poisoned by the presence of the poison of exhaustion, as
is the case with animals that have been hunted. The
manner in which we contrived to continue marching
when suffering, and the speed with which we recovered
when we got good food, were rather remarkable, and the
reason doubtless was that the dysentery was due to
poison, and was not produced by organic trouble.</p>

<p>Providentially we had a strong wind behind us during
that period of distress and this assuredly saved us, for
in our weakened state we could not have made long
marches against a head-wind, and without long marches
we would have starved between the depots.</p>

<p>In the early part of the journey over the level Barrier
surface we felt the heat of the sun severely, although the
temperature was very low. It was quite usual to feel
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">- 169 -</span>
one side of the face getting frozen while the other side
was being sunburnt. Later on when our strength had
begun to lessen, we found great difficulty in hoisting the
sail on our sledge, because when we lifted our arms over
our heads to adjust the sail, the blood ran from our fingers
and they promptly froze. Our troubles with frost-bite
were doubtless due partly to the lightness of our clothing,
but there was compensation for this in the greater speed
with which we were able to travel.</p>

<p>I am convinced that men engaged in polar exploration
should be clothed as lightly as possible, even if they are
in danger of being frost-bitten when they halt on the
march. We owe many grudges against the glacier which
caused us so many difficulties, but my chief one now is
that we brought back no photographs of a very interesting
portion of it. This was due to the facts that we expected
to take as many photographs as we had plates to spare
on our return journey, and that when we returned we
were so short of food that we could not afford the time
to unpack the camera.</p>

<p>The glacier itself presented every variety of surface,
from soft snow to cracked and riven blue ice, but later
the only constant feature were the crevasses, from which
we were never free.</p>

<p>Some were entirely covered with a crust of soft snow,
and we discovered them only when one of us broke
through and hung by his harness from the sledge. Others
occurred in mazes of rotten ice, and were even more
difficult to negotiate than the other sort. The sledges,
owing to their length, were not liable to slip down a
crevasse, and when we were securely attached to them
by their harness we felt fairly safe, but when the surface
was so bad that relay work was necessary we used to miss
the support of a sledge on the back journeys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">- 170 -</span></p>

<p>We would advance one sledge half a mile or a mile,
put up a bamboo pole to mark the spot, and then go back
for the other. For the walk back we were always roped
together, but even then we felt a great deal less secure
than when harnessed to one of the long, heavy sledges.</p>

<p>One pieceâ€”or two piecesâ€”of fortune we assuredly did
have upon the glacier, for both when we were struggling
up and scrambling down it the wind was behind us.
But on the glacier we were often troubled at night by
the fact that there was no snow on which to pitch our
tent, and consequently when we were weary after the
day's march an hour had frequently to be spent in smoothing
out a space for the camp on a rippled, sharp-pointed
sea of ice.</p>

<p>The provision bags and sledges were packed on the
snow cloths round the tents and it was indeed fortunate
for us that we met no bad weather while we were marching
up the glacier. Had a blizzard come on while we were
asleep, it would have scattered our goods far and wide,
and we would have been faced with a most serious
situation.</p>

<p>The upper glacier depot was overhung by great cliffs
of rock, shattered by the frosts and storms of countless
centuries, and many fragments were poised in such a
fashion that scarcely more than a touch seemed necessary
to bring them hurtling down. All around us on the ice
lay rocks that had recently fallen, and it was not a comforting
sensation to feel that at any moment a huge
boulder might drop upon our camp.</p>

<p>We had no choice of a camping-ground, as all around
was rough ice. The cliffs were composed largely of
weathered sandstone, and it was on the same mountain
higher up on the glacier that Wild discovered coal, at a
point where the slope was comparatively gentle.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">- 172 -</span></p>

<p>One of our greatest disappointments was that the
last ridge of the great glacier having been passed and
the actual plateau gained, we did not meet with a hard
surface, such as the <i>Discovery</i> expedition had encountered
in the journey to the plateau beyond the west of McMurdo
Sound, but still had to battle with soft snow and hard
sastrugi.</p>

<p>After the fierce blizzard which raged from the night
of January 6 until the morning of January 9, we had
better conditions under which to make our final march
southwards, for the wind had swept away the soft snow
and unencumbered with the sledge we could advance
more easily.</p>

<p>In reviewing the experience gained on the southern
journey, I do not think that I could suggest any important
improvements in equipment for future expeditions.
Evidently the Barrier surface varies remarkably, and the
traveller must be prepared for either a very hard or a
very soft surface, both of which he may encounter in the
same day's march.</p>

<p>On the glacier we should have been glad to have had
heavy Alpine boots with nails all round, but as the
temperature is too cold to permit of the explorer wearing
ordinary leather boots, some boot would have to be
designed which was at once warm enough for the feel
and strong enough to carry the nails.</p>

<p>Our clothing proved to be quite satisfactory, but
experience goes to show that a party which hopes to
reach the Pole must take more food per man than we did
I would in no case take cheese again, for chocolate is
more palatable and easier to divide.</p>

<p>Each member of our Southern Party had his own
particular duties to perform, Adams being responsible
for the meteorological observations which involvedâ€”among
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">- 173 -</span>
other dutiesâ€”the taking of temperatures at
regular intervals. Marshall took the meridian altitudes,
and the angles and bearings of all the new land, and his
work was most discomforting, for at the end of a day's
march and often at lunch-time as well, he would be
compelled to stand in the biting wind handling the screws
of the theodolite. He also prepared the map of the
journey and took most of the photographs.</p>

<p>Wild attended to the repair of the sledges and equipment,
and also assisted me in the geological observations
and the collection of specimens. My other work was to
keep the courses and distances, and to work out observations
and lay down our directions.</p>

<p>I kept two diaries, one my observation book, and the
other a narrative diary. But although all of us kept
diaries we were more often than I care to remember
too spent and cold at night to pay much attention to
them.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE RETURN OF THE "NIMROD"</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the winter the <i>Nimrod</i> had been laid up in
Port Lyttelton, and had been thoroughly overhauled so
that she should once more be ready to battle with the ice.
Captain F. P. Evans had been appointed master of the
ship under my power of attorney, Captain England having
resigned on account of ill-health, and towards the end
of the year sufficient stores were taken on board to
provide for a party staying at Cape Royds through the
winter, in case one of the sledging-parties had not returned,
and also to provide for the ship if she herself was frozen
up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">- 174 -</span></p>

<p>The <i>Nimrod</i> left Lyttelton again on December 1, 1908,
and enjoyed fine weather for the voyage southwards,
the experience of Captain Evans on this voyage going to
show that, under normal conditions, the pack that
stretches out from the Barrier to the eastward of the
Ross Sea is impenetrable, and that the <i>Discovery</i> was
able to push to within sight of King Edward VII Land
in 1902 because the ice was unusually open during that
season. Twenty-eight miles from Cape Royds fast ice
was encountered, and as there seemed to be no immediate
possibility of the ship being able to proceed, Captain
Evans decided to send Mackintosh with three men to
convey a mail-bag to the winter quarters. No very great
difficulties were anticipated for this expedition, but as
it turned out, not only difficulties but also dangers and
almost death were to be met with.</p>

<p>On January 3 Mackintosh set out with McGillan,
Riches and Paton, but in the afternoon Riches and Paton
returned to the ship and Mackintosh and McGillan
proceeded alone.</p>

<p>On the second day their way was blocked by open water
with pressure ice floating past, and although they walked
for two hours in a westerly direction to see how far the
water reached, they did not get to the end of it. The
whole of the ice to the southward seemed to be moving,
and as the open water seemed to take away any possibility
of reaching Cape Royds, they started back to the
ship.</p>

<p>Presently Mackintosh discovered that there was also
open water ahead of them, blocking the way to the
ship, and a survey of the position revealed the unpleasant
fact that the floe-ice was breaking up altogether, and
that they were in serious danger of drifting out into the
Sound. Safety lay only in a hurried dash for the shore
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">- 175 -</span>
to the east, and every two hundred yards or so they had
to drag their sledge to the edge of a floe, jump over a
lane of water, and then with a big effort pull the sledge
after them.</p>

<p>After an hour of this work their hands were cut and
bleeding, and their clothes were frozen as stiff as boards,
for they had frequently slipped and fallen when crossing
from floe to floe. At last, however, they approached the
land, and came to a piece of glacier ice that formed a
bridge. The floe that they were on was moving rapidly,
so they had to make a great effort and drag the sledge
over a six-foot breach. They succeeded in doing this
and were in a safe position again, but had they been fifteen
minutes later they would have been lost, for by that time
there was open water where they had gained the land.</p>

<p>Near this spot they decided to camp, and McGillan
was almost at once so badly attacked by snow-blindness
that his face was badly swollen and his eyes tightly
closed. So bad indeed was McGillan that, until Mackintosh
could bear the pain no longer in silence, he did not know
that his companion was suffering from the same complaint
as himself.</p>

<p>For several days they stayed in camp, and when their
eyes were better they studied the bird-life of the neighbourhood,
until, tired of seeing no sign of the ship.
Mackintosh decided that they would leave the heavy
mail-bag in their tent and march to Cape Royds. Then
followed one of those battles against crevasses and hidden
dangers with which those who take part in polar exploration
are too intimately acquainted. Once McGillan fell
into a yawning chasm and was only held up on a projection
of ice, and frequently one slip would have meant
the end of all things in this world for both of them.</p>

<p>At last a point was reached at which their way was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">- 176 -</span>
blocked in every direction by crevasses, ascent was no
longer possible, and below them lay a steep slope running
down for about 300 ft. What lay at the bottom they
could not tell, but their case was desperate and they
decided to glissade down.</p>

<p>Their knives, which they attempted to use as brakes,
were torn from their grasp, but they managed to keep
their heels in the snow and to reach the bottom in safety.</p>

<p>Hunger had seized them for they had practically no
food left, but two hours after they had dashed down the
slope they could see Cape Royds and hoped soon to be
at the winter quarters.</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards, however, such thick snow
began to fall that they could not see two yards ahead,
and for hours they were stumbling along in the blinding
storm. Occasionally they rested for a few minutes, but
icicles hung from their faces, and they did not dare to
stay still for long.</p>

<p>Heavy snow continued to cut off all view of the surrounding
country, and they had been wandering for
twenty-seven hours after their glissade, when Day found
them in a state of complete exhaustion, and just staggering
along because they knew that to stop meant death.
Had not Day been outside the hutâ€”to which the travellers
had no idea they were closeâ€”watching for the return
of the ship, that expedition, undertaken so light-heartedly,
must almost certainly have been a fatal one to Mackintosh
and McGillan.</p>

<p>The two weary men reached the hut on January 12,
but a week before that date the <i>Nimrod</i> had arrived at
Cape Royds, and had gone north again to search for
them. Doomed to disappointment and horror were the
men at the hut when they learned that not only were
they not to have any letters, but that also Mackintosh
and McGillan had left the ship on the 3rd to try to bring
the letters more quickly over the sea-ice and over the
bay, which even then was filled with loose pack and
which a few days before had been open water.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">- 178 -</span></p>

<p>On January 7 the <i>Nimrod</i> left Cape Royds again to
seek for the lost men, and in a few hours was beset by
ice, and so remained for practically the whole of the
time between the 7th and the 15th. On the afternoon
of the 16th, however, the ship cleared the ice, and
approached the only piece of shore on which there was
a chance of finding Mackintosh and McGillan. Near the
end of a stretch of beach a small patch of greenish colour
was seen, and the telescope revealed the details of a
deserted camp and a tent torn to ribbons. A boat was
at once sent ashore, and the bag of letters was discovered,
and also a note from Mackintosh telling of his risky
attempt to cross the mountains.</p>

<p>As Murray, who was on the ship, knew the frightfully
crevassed character of the ground which Mackintosh and
McGillan had determined to cross, little hope of their
safety remained.</p>

<p>Judge, then, the joy of those on board the <i>Nimrod</i>
when two men came out to meet the ship on its arrival
at Cape Royds, and one of them was seen to be McGillan.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE WESTERN PARTY</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">How</span> well Joyce and his party, consisting of Mackintosh,
Day and Martin, placed a depot of stores about fourteen
miles off Minna Bluff, and how glad the Southern Party
were to find them there has already been told.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">- 179 -</span></p>

<p>In the depoting of these stores Joyce made two journeys,
starting for the first from winter quarters on January 15
and returning to Hut Point on January 31, and leaving
there again with a second load of stores (which had been
brought by a party from the <i>Nimrod</i>) and reaching the
Bluff Depot for the second time on February 8.</p>

<p>On their re-arrival at this depot they found, to their surprise,
that the Southern Party had not appeared, and for
some days Joyce and his companions searched the horizon
with glasses, in the hope of sighting the overdue travellers.</p>

<p>They waited until the Southern Party was eleven days
after the time fixed for their return, and then decided to
lay a depot flag in towards the Bluff so that by no chance
could the food be missed, and, secondly, to march due
south to look for the Southern Party. In this march
they were, as is known, unsuccessful in finding the weary
travellers, and eventually they returned to the Bluff
Depot and found everything as they had left it.</p>

<p>Filled with gloomy thoughts as to the fate of Adams,
Marshall, Wild and myselfâ€”for we were then eighteen
days overdueâ€”they started on the 16th to march back
to the coast. But although they did not find us, they had
nevertheless saved our lives by the provisions they had
so laboriously brought to the depot.</p>

<p>At the same time that we of the Southern Party were
fighting our way towards the Pole, the Western Party,
consisting of Armytage, Priestley and Brocklehurst,
were working in the western mountains.</p>

<p>On December 9 they left winter quarters and reached
the "stranded moraines" four days later. These moraines,
which were found by the <i>Discovery</i> expedition, are relics
of the days of more extensive glaciation, and as they
present a most varied collection of rocks they are of
very great interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">- 180 -</span></p>

<p>There the party succeeded in securing a large number
of skuas' eggs, but the anticipated feast was not enjoyed,
for, to quote the words of one of the expedition, only
about a dozen of the eggs were "good enough for eating."
The other eggs were thrown on the snow near the tent,
with the result that there was an invasion of skuas, the
birds not only eating the eggs but also making themselves
a nuisance by pulling about the sledge-harness
and the stores. Geological specimens this party secured
in valuable abundance, and, as was the case with the
other sledging expeditions that were out at the time, a
special feast was provided for Christmas Day.</p>

<p>That Priestley enjoyed this feast is shown by his diary,
in which he wrote, "The plum pudding was 'top-hole.'
Must remember to give one of the pot-holed sandstones
to Wild for the New Zealand girl who gave him the
plum pudding."</p>

<p>This party were on the look-out for the men who had
gone north in search of the Magnetic Pole, but failing to
find any sign of them, they went back to their depot
on January 14 and pitched camp to wait for the Northern
Party until the 25th, when they were either to make their
way back to winter quarters or to signal for the ship by
means of the heliograph.</p>

<p>On the 24th, however, this party had the narrowest
escape from never seeing either winter quarters or the
<i>Nimrod</i> again. They were camped on the sea-ice at the
foot of Butter Point, in a position which to all appearances
was one of safety. Armytage indeed had examined the
tide-crack along the shore and had found no signs of
more than ordinary movement, and the ice all round
seemed to be quite fast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">- 181 -</span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">- 182 -</span></p>

<p>But early in the morning of the 24th, Priestley, who
was first out of the tent, abruptly dispelled any feelings
of security that his companions possessed. At once he
discovered that the ice they were on had broken away
and was drifting north to the open sea, and, returning to
tell the others, they immediately turned out, to find
that this statement was only too true. Two miles of
open water already intervened between the floe and the
shore, and they were to all appearances moving steadily
out.</p>

<p>"When," Armytage wrote in his report, "we found
that the ice had gone out, we loaded up the sledge and
started to see whether we could get off the floe to the
north. The position seemed to be rather serious, for we
could not hope to cross any stretch of open water, there
was no reasonable chance of assistance from the ship,
and most of our food was at Butter Point. We had not
gone very far to the north when we came to an impassable
lane of open water, and we decided to return to our original
position. We went into camp and had breakfast at
11 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>"</p>

<p>After that the three men waited for some time on the
off-chance of the ship coming along one of the lanes and
picking them up, or of the current changing and the ice
once more touching the shore, but at the end of four
anxious hours there was no improvement in their position.
Killer-whales were spouting in the channels, and occasionally
bumping the ice under the floe.</p>

<p>Unable to wait any longer, the party marched right
round the floe but met with open water in every direction,
and at 10 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> they were back in their old position, only
encouraged by the fact that they had apparently stopped
moving north, and were possibly getting a little nearer
to fast ice again.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards Brocklehurst turned out to see if the
position had changed, and reported that the floe seemed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">- 183 -</span>
to be within a few hundred yards of the fast ice, and was
still moving in that direction. Then Armytage got up,
and half an hour later saw that the floe was only about
two hundred yards off fast ice.</p>

<p>"I ran back," he reported, "as fast as I could, deciding
that there was a prospect of an attempt to get ashore
proving successful, and gave the other two men a
shout.</p>

<p>They struck camp and loaded up within a few minutes,
while I went back to the edge of the floe at the spot
towards which chance had first directed my steps. Just
as the sledge got up to me I felt the floe bump the fast
ice. Not more than six feet of the edge touched, but we
were just at that spot, and we rushed over the bridge
thus formed. We had only just got over when the floe
moved away again, and this time it went north to the
open sea. The only place at which it touched the fast
ice was that to which I had gone when I left the tent,
and had I happened to go to any other spot we would
not have escaped."</p>

<p>After this Providential deliverance from a perilous
situation, the party made their way back to Butter
Point and camped about 3 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>; and when they got up
some hours later open water was to be seen where they
had been drifting on the floe, and also the <i>Nimrod</i> was
sighted some miles out.</p>

<p>The heliograph was flashed to the vessel, and in the
afternoon the partyâ€”having left a depot of provisions
and oil at Butter Point in case the northern travellers
should arrive thereâ€”were safe on board again.</p>

<p>Towards' the end of January fine weather was very
rare, for the season was advanced, and consequently the
fast ice remaining in the Sound began to break up quickly
and took the form of pack trending northwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">- 184 -</span></p>

<p>The waiting for the other parties to come in was
unpleasant for the remaining members of the shore-party
and for those on board the ship, because the time
was approaching when the <i>Nimrod</i> must either leave
for the north or be frozen in for the winter. And still
both the Southern and the Northern Parties tarried.</p>

<p>Instructions had been left that if the Northern Party
had not returned by February 1, a search was to be made
along the western coast in a northerly direction. This
party by that time was three weeks overdue, and so
Captain Evans proceeded north with the <i>Nimrod</i> on
the 1st, and began closely to examine the coast. This
search was both dangerous and difficult, for Captain
Evans had to keep near to the coast, in order to guard
against the chance of missing any signal, and the sea
was obstructed by pack-ice. The work, however, was
done most thoroughly in the face of what Captain Evans
afterwards described as "small navigational difficulties."</p>

<p>"Dear Sir," I wrote to the Professor, "you will
leave winter quarters on or about October 1, 1908. The
main objects of your journey to be as follows:</p>

<p>"(1) To take magnetic observations at every suitable
point, in order to determine the dip and position
of the Magnetic Pole; and if time, equipment, and
supplies are sufficient, you will try to reach the Magnetic
Pole.</p>

<p>"(2) To make a general geological survey of the
coast of Victoria Land; this work, however, is not to
interfere with your attempt to reach the Pole.</p>

<p>"(3) I particularly wish you to be able, to work at
the geology of the Western Mountains, and for Mawson
to spend at least a fortnight at Dry Valley to prospect
for minerals of economic value on your return from the
north. I do not wish to limit you to an exact date for
return to Dry Valley, if you think that by lengthening
your stay up north you can reach the Magnetic Pole;
but I consider that the thorough investigation of this
valley is of supreme importance.</p>

<p>"(4) The <i>Nimrod</i> is expected in the Sound about
January 15, 1909. If the ship is not in, or if she does
not see your signals, you will take into account your
supply of provisions, and proceed either to Glacier
Tongue or Hut Point to replenish, if you have not sufficient
provisions at Butter Point.</p>

<p>"(5) At Butter Point a depot of at least fourteen days'
food and oil will be laid for you.</p>

Nimrod to proceed to the most accessible point at the
west coast and there ship all your specimens.</p>

there is no evidence that your party has returned, the

<span class="smaller">THE NARRATIVE OF PROFESSOR DAVID<br />
WE START FOR THE MAGNETIC POLE</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first thing to be done in connection with our attempt
to reach the Magnetic Pole was to lay depots, and so
on September 25, after delay from bad weather, Priestley,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">- 188 -</span>
Day and I (David) started in the motor-car, dragging
behind us two sledges over the ice.</p>

<p>One sledge with its load weighed 606 lb., the other
250 lb., and as soon as Day put the car on her second
gear we sped over the floe-ice at a rate of fourteen miles
an hour, much to the admiration of the seals and penguins.
Accidents, however, both to the car and to Day, who
alone of us could be trusted to drive it, hindered us from
making our final start until October 5. On that day
Brocklehurst took a photograph of the Northern Party
and soon afterwards we boarded the car and the sledges
and, cheered by those remaining behind, proceeded on
our way.</p>

<p>At first Day, Priestley and Roberts accompanied us,
but we had only gone a little over two miles, when the
snow had become so thick that I did not think it prudent
to take the car farther, and accordingly we had to say
good-bye to our companions. Strapping on our harness,
we toggled on to the sledge rope, and with a "One,
two, three and away," we began our long journey over
the sea-ice.</p>

<p>On the following morning we had to start our relay
work, and dragged the Christmas Tree sledge on first,
as we were specially liable to lose parcels off it, for a
distance of nearly half a mile. Then we returned and
fetched up what we called the Plum Duff sledge, chiefly
laden with our provisions.</p>

<p>After a heavy day's work on the following day, we
camped for the night close to a seal-hole which belonged
to a fine specimen of Weddell seal, but our slumbers were
disturbed by the snorting and whistling of the seals
as they came up for their blows.</p>

<p>The seals, however, were nothing to the Emperor
penguins, which awakened us by their chatter on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">- 189 -</span>
morning of the 10th. Evidently they had marched down
on our tent during the night to investigate us, and the
sounds they made may be described as something
between the cackle of a goose and the chortle of a
kookaburra.</p>

<p>I saw four of them standing by the sledges, and when
they caught sight of me they were much interested,
and the conversation between them became very lively.
I have no doubt that they took us for penguins of an
inferior type, and the tent for our nest. At any rate,
they were kind enough to take careful note of our doings,
and to give us a good send-off when we left them.</p>

<p>During that day a blizzard was behind us, and as
the strength of it increased we found that we could
draw both sledges at the same time, which was, of course,
a great saving of labour. Tempted, however, to continue
our march under these favourable conditions, we went
on longer than was wise, with the result that when we
stopped it was extremely difficult to get the tent up.</p>

<p>Slipping the tent over the poles placed close to the
ground in the lee of the sledge, two of us raised the
poles while the other shovelled snow on to the skirt of
the tent, which we pulled out by degrees until it was
finally spread to its full dimensions. Glad indeed were
we to turn in and escape from the biting blast and drifting
snow.</p>

<p>This violent blizzard blew throughout the whole of
the next day, and we spent it for the most part in our
sleeping-bags; but on the 13th we arrived at Butter
Point, which is merely an angle in the low ice-cliff near
the junction of the Ferrar Glacier valley with the main
shore of Victoria Land, and made a depot there.</p>

<p>Altogether we lightened our load by about 70 lb., and
we also left letters there for Lieutenant Shackleton and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">- 190 -</span>
R. E. Priestley respectively, stating that in consequence
of our late start from Cape Royds, and also on account
of the slowness of our progress thence to Butter Point,
we could not return to the Point until January 12 at
the earliest, instead of the first week in January, as had
been anticipated. Months later we heard that this little
depot survived the blizzards, and that Armytage,
Priestley and Brocklehurst had read our letters.</p>

<p>A few days later we landed at Cape Bernacchi, and
on October 17 we hoisted the Union Jack and took
possession of Victoria Land for the British Empire.
The geology of Cape Bernacchi is extremely interesting,
the dominant type of rock being a pure white coarsely
crystalline marble, which has been broken through by
granite rocks, the latter in places containing small red
garnets.</p>

<p>On the next day we reached a headland where the
rocks resembled those at Cape Bernacchi, and Mawson
considered that some of the quartz veins traversing this
headland would prove to be gold-bearing.</p>

<p>That same night I was attacked by snow-blindness
through neglecting to wear my snow-goggles regularly,
and as I was no better when the time came for us to
march, I asked Mawson to take my place at the end of
the long rope, the foremost position in the team. So
remarkably proficient was he on this occasion, and
afterwards, at picking out the best track for our sledges
and in steering a good course, that at my request he
occupied this position throughout the rest of the journey.</p>

<p>Uneventful days followed, but by the 23rd it was
quite clear that at our rate of travellingâ€”about four
statute miles daily by the relay methodâ€”we could not
get to the Pole and back to Butter Point early in January,
so we held a serious council as to the future of our journey
towards the Magnetic Pole, and I suggested that the
most likely means to get there and back in the time
specified by Lieutenant Shackleton would be to travel
on half-rations, depoting the remainder of our provision
at an early opportunity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">- 192 -</span></p>

<p>After some discussion, Mawson and Mackay agreed
to try this expedient, and we decided to think over the
matter for a few days and then make our depot-.</p>

<p>In pursuing our north-westerly course we presently
passed a magnificent bay, which trended westwards
some five or six miles away from the course we were
steering. On either side of this bay were majestic ranges
of rocky mountains, parted from one another at the
head of the bay by an immense glacier with steep ice
falls.</p>

<p>On either side of this glacier were high terraces of
rock reaching back for several miles from a modern
valley edge to the foot of still higher ranges. It was
obvious that these terraces marked the position of the
floor of the old valley at a time when the glacier ice was
several thousand feet higher and some ten miles wider
than it was when we saw it.</p>

<p>We longed to explore these inland rocks, but time was
too precious. Later on we discovered that the point
opposite which we had arrived was really Granite
Harbour, and that its position was not correctly shewn
on the chart.</p>

<p>By the night of October 29 we were all thoroughly
done up after completing our four miles of relay work,
and we discussed the important question whether it
was possible to eke out our food supplies with seal-meat
so as to avoid putting ourselves on half-rations, and
we all agreed that this should be done. The chief problem
in connection with the seal-meat was how to cook it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">- 193 -</span>
without the aid of paraffin oil, for we could not afford
paraffin for that purpose.</p>

<p>On the next day we tried the experiment of strengthening
the brew of the tea by using the old tea-leaves of a
previous meal mixed with the new onesâ€”an idea of
Mackay's which Mawson and I did not appreciate at
first, though later on we were glad enough to adopt it.</p>

<p>By this time the weather had become warmer, and
consequently the saline snow on the sea-ice was sticky,
and gripped the runners of the sledges like glue. Only
by the greatest exertion could we drag the sledges along
even at a snail's pace.</p>

<p>But although we were thoroughly exhausted when we
camped on the evening of the 30th, our evening meal
revived us so much that we walked over to a small
island about three-quarters of a mile distant, which
turned out to be a truly wonderful place for a geologist
and a perfect paradise for the mineralogist.</p>

<p>On this island, which we afterwards called Depot
Island, Mawson discovered a translucent brown mineral,
which was proved to be titanium mineral.</p>

<span class="smaller">ACROSS THE ICE BARRIER</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">How</span> to reach the Pole was still our engrossing subject
of discussion, and on November 1 we decided that our
only hope of reaching it, was by travelling on half-rations
from the point we had reached to the point on the coast
at the Drygalski Glacier, where we might hope to be
able to turn inland with reasonable prospect of success.
Mawson was convinced that we must keep six weeks of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">- 194 -</span>
full rations for our inland journey, and this meant that
we must march on half-rations for about 100 miles.</p>

<p>While I was busy in calculating times and distances
for the remainder of our journey, Mawson and Mackay
conducted experiments upon the cooking of seal-meat
with blubber. At winter quarters Mackay had experimented
with blubber as a fuel, but his efforts had not
been taken seriously, and, to our sorrow, his blubber
lamp had been left behind.</p>

<p>Eventually, however, as a result of Mackay and
Mawson's experiments, we secured an effective cooking
stove, which was made out of one of our large empty
biscuit tins, and a broth from seal-meat was made upon
this stove. The broth was apparently very nutritious,
but in my case it was also indigestible.</p>

<p>While Mawson was still engaged on cooking experiments,
Mackay and I went to the highest point of the
island, and chose a spot for a cairn to mark our depot
and Mackay began to build the cairn.</p>

<p>It had, of course, become clear to us, from what we
had already seen of the cracking sea-ice, combined with
our slow progress, that our retreat back to camp from
the direction of the Magnetic Pole would probably be
cut off altogether through the breaking up of the sea-ice.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances we resolved to take the
risk of the <i>Nimrod</i> returning safely to Cape Royds,
where she would be instructed to search for us along the
western coast; and also the risk of her not being able
to find our depot and ourselves.</p>

<p>We knew that there was some danger in this course,
but we also felt that we had got on so far with the work
entrusted to us by our commander that we could not
honourably turn back.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances we each wrote farewell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">- 195 -</span>
letters to those who were nearest and dearest, and at
4.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on the following morning we posted them in
one of our empty dried-milk tins, which had an air-tight
lid, and, having walked up to the cairn, I lashed our
post-office to the flagstaff by means of cord and copper
wire.</p>

<p>There we also left several bags of geological specimens,
and with lighter loads were prepared to go onwards
towards the Pole.</p>

<p>It was later than usual when we left our depot, and
as the sun's heat was already thawing the surface of
the snow our progress was painfully slow. So terribly
hard, indeed, was it to get along at all, that, after going
two miles, we camped and resolved to go on again at
midnight, when we hoped to avoid the sticky surface.</p>

<p>This experiment was fairly successful, and by November
5 we were opposite to a most interesting panorama
some twenty miles north of Granite Harbour.</p>

<p>During that same day we had a very heavy surface
to hamper and tire us, but as an offset to these troubles
we had that night, for the first time, the use of a new
frying-pan, ingeniously constructed by Mawson out of
one of our empty paraffin tins. Indeed, Mawson's cooking
experiments continued to be highly successful and entirely
satisfactory to the party.</p>

<p>At this time we encountered a good deal of brash ice,
and noticed that this type of ice surface was most common
in the vicinity of icebergs. The brash ice is, I think,
formed by the icebergs surging to and fro in heavy
weather and crunching up the sea-ice near to them.
The sea-ice, of course, refreezes, producing a surface
covered with jagged edges and points.</p>

<p>But although brash ice was too plentiful biscuits were
too scarce, and we were already reduced to one Plasmon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">- 196 -</span>
biscuit each for breakfast and one for evening meals,
and we had become exceedingly careful over the crumbs.
At first, on this expedition, when biscuits were more
plentiful we had munched them boldly, regardless of the
loss of crumbs. Not so at this time, when crumbs were
collected most carefully by the man to whom they
belonged.</p>

<p>Uneventful days of sledging followedâ€”days on which
we were tired at night and hungry nearly always; but
on the 9th we were cheered by a fine, though distant,
view of the Nordenskjold Ice Barrier to the north of us,
and we were all extremely anxious to find out what sort
of surface for sledging this great glacier was going to
offer us.</p>

<p>According to the Admiralty chart, prepared from
observations by the <i>Discovery</i> expedition, this glacier
was twenty-four to thirty miles wide, and projected
over twenty miles from the rocky shore into the sea.
We hoped that we should be able to cross it without
following a circuitous route along its seaward margins.</p>

<p>Two days later we reached the Nordenskjold Ice
Barrier, and as Mawson wished to take some observations,
Mackay and I decided to explore the glacier for
the purpose of selecting a suitable track (if we could find
it) for our sledges.</p>

<p>On our return we were able to tell Mawson the good
news that the barrier was quite practicable for sledging;
while he informed us that, as the result of his observations,
the Magnetic Pole was probably about forty miles
further inland than the theoretical mean position
calculated for it from the magnetic observations of the
<i>Discovery</i> expedition seven years before.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the 12th we packed up and
started to cross the barrier, and on the second day we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">- 197 -</span>
had not sledged for more than a thousand yards when
Mawson suddenly exclaimed that he could see the end
of the barrier, where it ended in a white cliff some
600 yards ahead.</p>

<p>We halted the sledge, and while Mawson took some
theodolite angles Mackay and I tried to find a way down
the cliff, but failed to find it. Once more we reconnoitred,
and this time Mawson and I found some steep slopes
formed by drift snow, which were just practicable for
a light sledge lowered by an alpine rope.</p>

<p>We chose what seemed to be the best of these slopes
and Mackay, having tied the rope round his body and
having taken his ice-axe, went down the slope cautiously,
Mawson and I holding on to the rope meanwhile.</p>

<p>The snow gave a good foothold, and he was soon at
the bottom without needing support from the rope. Then,
when he had returned to the top, we all set to work
unpacking the sledges, and after loading one sledge
lightly we lowered it little by little down the slope, one
of us guiding the sledge while the other two slackened
out the alpine rope above. The man who went to the
bottom unloaded the sledge on the sea-ice, and then
climbed back again, while the others hauled up the empty
sledge. This manÅ“uvre was repeated again and again
until everything was safe, and we very glad to have
crossed the ice barrier so quickly. There can be little
doubt, I think, that this Nordenskjold Ice Barrier is
afloat.</p>

<p>On the following day we were naturally anxious to
be sure of our exact position on the chart, in view of
the fact that we had come to the end of the barrier
some eighteen miles quicker than the chart had led us
to anticipate. Accordingly, Mawson worked up his
meridian altitude, while I plotted out the angular distances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">- 198 -</span>
he had found respectively for Mount Erebus,
Mount Lister and Mount Melbourne.</p>

<p>As the result of the application of our calculations to
the chart it became evident that we were opposite to
what on Captain Scott's chart was termed Charcot
Bay, and consequently were nearly twenty miles nearer
north than we had thought ourselves to be. This was
splendid news, and cheered us up very much.</p>

<p>We were still travelling by night and sleeping during
the afternoon, and when we got out of our sleeping-bags
at 8 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> on the night of the 15th there was a
beautifully perfect "Noah's Ark" in the sky. We also
saw fleecy sheets of frost-smoke arising from over the
open water on Ross Sea, and forming dense cumulus
clouds. This warned us that open water was not far
away, and impressed us with the necessity of pushing
on if we hoped to reach our projected point of departure
on the coast for the Magnetic Pole before the sea-ice
entirely broke up.</p>

<p>Difficult surfaces continued to beset us, and our
progress was consequently exceedingly slow.</p>

<p>By the 24th we were suffering both from exhaustion
and want of sleep, and I rued the day when we chose
the three-man bag in preference to the one-man bag.</p>

<p>A three-man sleeping-bag, where you are wedged in
more or less tightly against your mates, where all snore
and shin one another, and where each man feels on
waking that he is more shinned against than shinning, is
not conducive to real rest.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE DRYGALSKI GLACIER</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> November 26 Mawson and I ascended a rocky promontory,
while Mackay was securing some seal-meat,
and from the top we had a splendid view across the level
surface of sea-ice far below us.</p>

<p>But although what we saw was magnificent, it was
also discomforting, for at a few miles from the shore an
enormous iceberg, frozen into the floe, lay right across
the path which we had meant to travel on the next day.</p>

<p>To the north-west of us was Geikie Inlet, and beyond
that, stretching as far as the eye could follow, was the
great Drygalski Glacier. Not a little concerned were we
to observe with our field-glasses that the surface of this
glacier was wholly different to that of the Nordenskjold
Ice Barrier.</p>

<p>Clearly the surface of the Drygalski Glacier was formed
of jagged surfaces of ice very heavily crevassed, but we
could see that at the extreme eastern extension, some
thirty miles from where we were standing, the surface
appeared to be fairly smooth.</p>

<p>It was also obvious to us, from what we had seen
looking out to sea to the east of our camp, that there
were large bodies of open water at no great distance
from us trending shorewards in the form of long lanes.
The lanes of water were only partly frozen over, and
some of these were interposed between us and the Drygalski
Glacier.</p>

<p>Not a moment was to be lost if we were to reach the
glacier before the sea-ice broke up, for one strong blizzard
would have converted the whole of the sea-ice between
us and the glacier into a mass of drifting pack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">- 200 -</span></p>

<p>The thing, indeed, for us to do was to push on with
all our might, and still with slushy surfaces to hinder us
we pulled and tramped untilâ€”on the 28thâ€”we came to
a point where for some time it seemed as if our progress
further north was completely blocked. Eventually,
however, we found a place where the ice might just bear
our sledges, and, having strengthened it by laying down
slabs of sea-ice and shovelfuls of snow, we rushed our
sledges over safely. Extremely thankful were we to get
them over to the other side, for the ice was so thin that
it bent under our weight, and once Mackay broke through
and very nearly got a ducking.</p>

<p>Next we had to encounter some very high sastrugi of
hard tough snow, and as these were nearly at right-angles
to our course, the work of dragging our sledges
over them was very distressing. And after the sastrugi
we met with an ice-surface which kept continually cracking
as we passed over it, with a noise like that of a whip
being cracked.</p>

<p>We were unable by this time to talk about anything
but cereal foods, such as cakes of various kinds and
fruits, for we were very short of biscuits and were consequently
seized with food obsessions.</p>

<p>The sun, however, which had during the afternoons
considerable heating power, and in one way was hindering
us by making the surfaces so slushy, helped us in another
way. For when I put some snow into our aluminium
cooking-pot and exposed it for several hoursâ€”while we
were campingâ€”to the direct rays of the suns, I was
glad to find that half the snow was thawed down,
a result that, of course, saved us both paraffin and
blubber.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">- 202 -</span></p>

<p>On the 30th the ice ridges fronting us became higher
and steeper, and strain we ever so mightily we could
scarcely get the sledges to move up the steep ice slopes,
and the sledges also skidded a good deal as we dragged
them obliquely upwards.</p>

<p>The glacier was now spread before us as a great billowy
sea of pale green ice, with here and there high embankments
of marble-like <i>nÃ©vÃ©</i> resembling railway embankments.
Unfortunately for our progress, the trend of the
latter was nearly at right-angles to our course, and as
we advanced the undulations became more and more
pronounced, the embankments higher and steeper.</p>

<p>These embankments were bounded by cliffs from forty
to fifty feet in height, with overhanging cornices of tough
snow. The cliffs faced northwards, and such serious
obstacles were the deep chasms which they produced
to our advance that we had often to go a long way round
in order to head them off.</p>

<p>December began with a very laborious day, and after
battling on for several hours we had only advanced a
little over half a mile. So we decided to camp, for Mackay
and me to try to find a way for the sledge out of the
maze of chasms that beset us, and for Mawson to take
magnetic observations.</p>

<p>During that afternoon we discussed our situation at
some length. Most probably the Drygalski Glacier was
twenty miles wide, and if we were to cross it along the
course we were travelling at the rate of a mile a day it
would take us twenty days to get over, even if we took
no account of the unforeseen delays which our experience
had already taught us were sure to occur. From what
Mackay and I had seen ahead of us, our difficulties were
bound, for a considerable distance, to increase rather
than grow less.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances we were reluctantly forced
to the conclusion that our only hope of ultimate success<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">- 203 -</span>
lay in retreat, and so we resolved to drag the sledges back
off the glacier on to the sea-ice by the way along which
we had come.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> retreat began early on the morning of December 2,
and after a week's struggle on the glacier Mackay, just
before camping-time on the 9th, sighted open water on
the northern edge of the Drygalski Ice Barrier, from three
to four miles away. This convinced us that we could not
hope for sea-ice over which to sledge westwards to that
part of the shore where we proposed to make our final
depot, before attempting the ascent of the great inland
plateau in order to reach the Magnetic Pole.</p>

<p>On the 10th, however, at the end of the day's sledging
we rejoiced to find ourselves off the true glacier type of
surface, and on to one of the undulating barrier type.
This improvement enabled us to steer westwards, and
on the following day we had a fine view of "Terra Nova"
Bay, and as far as could be judged the edge of the Drygalski
Ice Barrier on the north was scarcely a mile distant.</p>

<p>So surprised were we at the general appearance of the
outline of the ice, which did not seem to agree with
the shape of this region as shown on the Admiralty chart,
that we halted a little earlier than usual to reconnoitre.
Mackay started off with the field-glasses to a conspicuous
ice-mound about half a mile to the north-west, Mawson
began to change his plates, while I went out with my
sketch-book to get an outline panoramic view of the
grand coast ranges in sight.</p>

<p>So few had been the crevasses of late that I failed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">- 204 -</span>
take my ice-axe with me and I had scarcely gone half
a dozen yards from the tent when the lid of a crevasse
collapsed under me, and let me down nearly up to my
shoulders.</p>

<p>I only saved myself from going right down by throwing
out my arms and staying myself on the snow-lid on
either side. The lid was so rotten that I did not dare to
move for fear that I might be thrown into the abyss,
but fortunately Maws on was near, and on my calling to
him he brought an ice-axe and chipped a hole in the
firm ice on the edge of the crevasse nearest to me. Then
he inserted the chisel edge of the ice-axe in the hole and,
holding on to the pick-point, swung the handle towards me.
Grasping this, I was able to climb out on to the solid
ice.</p>

<p>On the following day we sledged on until we were close
to the ice-mound already mentioned, and decided that
as this mound commanded such a general view of the
surrounding country, it must also be a conspicuous object
to any one approaching the Drygalski Glacier by sea
from the north. And so we decided that as we could find
no trace of the "low, sloping shore"â€”as it was called
on the Admiralty chartâ€”we would make our depot at
this spot.</p>

<p>We estimated that we still had 220 miles to travel
from this depot on the Drygalski Glacier to the Magnetic
Pole, and therefore it was necessary to make preparations
for a journey there and back of at least 440 miles. We
considered that with <i>dÃ©tours</i> the journey might possibly
amount to 500 miles.</p>

<p>Our first business, therefore, was to lay in a stock of
provisions sufficient to last us for our journey, and after
Mackay had killed some seals and Emperor penguins
we started cooking our meat for the trip. Our calculation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">- 205 -</span>
was that the total weightâ€”when we depoted one sledge
with spare equipment and all our geological specimensâ€”would
be 670 lb. But we were very doubtful whether we,
in our stale and weakened condition, would be able to
pull such a load.</p>

<p>We unpacked and examined both sledges, and found
that of the two, the runners of the Duff sledge were the
less damaged.</p>

<p>On the 14th we were still busy preparing for the great
trek inland. Mackay was cooking meat, Mawson was
employed in transferring the scientific instrument boxes
and other things from the Christmas Tree sledge to the
Duff sledge, while I was engaged on fixing up depot flags,
writing letters to the commander of the <i>Nimrod</i>, Lieutenant
Shackleton, and my family, and fixing up a milk-tin
to serve as a post office on to the depot flag-pole.</p>

<p>When we were fully prepared the Christmas Tree
sledge was dragged to the top of the ice-mound, where
we cut trenches with our ice-axes in which to embed
the runners of the sledge; then we fixed the runners
into these grooves, piled the chipped ice on top, and then
lashed the flag-pole about six feet high with the black
flag displayed on the top of it very carefully to the
sledge. We all felt quite sorry to part with the Christmas
Tree sledge, which by this time seemed to us like a bit
of home.</p>

<p>Anxious as we were to start for our dash towards the
Pole, we were prevented by a furious blizzard from
getting on our way until the 16th. Then we were delighted
to find that, in consequence of our three days' rest we
were able to pull our sledge with comparative ease.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards we reached another open tide-crack,
and had to spend some time in going round it, and on
the far side of this crack we encountered a large pressure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">- 206 -</span>
ridge forming a high and steep slope which barred our
advance. Its height was about eighty feet, but if we
were to go on there was nothing to do but drag our sledge
up the slope, a most exhausting work which was made
more difficult still by the fact that this ice-slope was
traversed by numerous crevasses.</p>

<p>At last we got up the slope, only to see in the dim light
that a succession of similar slopes were ahead of us,
becoming continually higher and steeper. The ice, too,
became a perfect network of crevasses, some of which
were partly open, but most of them covered with snow
lids.</p>

<p>Suddenly, when crossing one of these lids, and just as
he was about to reach firm ice on the other side, we heard
a slight crash, and Mawson instantly disappeared. Fortunately
the toggle at the end of his sledge-rope held,
and he was left swinging in the empty space between
the walls of the crevasse, being suspended by his harness
attached to the sledge-rope.</p>

<p>Mackay and I hung on to the rope in case it should part
at the toggle, but when Mawson called out for the alpine
rope to be passed down to him I left Mackay and hurried
back to the sledge to get it. Just, however, as I was
trying to disengage a coil of rope, Mawson called out that
he felt he was going, so I returned to help Mackay in his
effort to keep a strain on Mawson's harness rope. Then
Mawson said that he was all right, and the rope having
suddenly cut back through the lid of the crevasse was
probably the reason why he had felt that he was falling.</p>

<p>I now held on to the harness rope while Mackay got
the alpine rope, and made a bow-line at the end in which
Mawson could put his foot. In the meantime Mawson,
who was down about eight feet below the level of the
snowy lid, secured some ice crystals from the side of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">- 207 -</span>
crevasse and threw them up for subsequent examination.</p>

<p>The alpine rope having been lowered, we eventually
hoisted him up little by little to the under surface of
the snow-lid, but as his harness rope had cut back a
narrow groove in this snow-lid several feet from where
the snow gave way under him, he found his head and
shoulders pressing against the under side of the snow-lid
and had difficulty in breaking through this in order
to get out his head.</p>

<p>At last the top of his head appeared, and presently he
got safely out on the near side of the crevasse, a deliverance
for which we were all supremely thankful. After
this too-exciting episode we were extra-cautious in
crossing crevasses, but the ice was simply seamed with
them.</p>

<p>Twice when our sledge was being dragged up ice-pressure
ridges it rolled over sideways with one runner
in a crevasse, and once the whole sledge all but disappeared
into a crevasse, the snow-lid of which partly collapsed
under its weight. Had it gone down completely we should
certainly have been dragged down with it, as it weighed
nearly one-third of a ton.</p>

<p>It was clear to us that these numerous crevasses which
we had reached were caused not by the Drygalski but
by the Nansen Glacier.</p>

<p>On the 20th we held a council of war, the question
being whether we should continue in the direction of
the Mount Nansen Glacier, or whether we should retreat
and try to find some other way to the plateau. Mackay
was in favour of hauling ahead over the glacier, while
Mawson and I favoured retreat, and at last we decided
to retreat once more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">So</span> far as the possibility of reaching the Magnetic Pole
was concerned, our fortunes seemed to have reached a
low ebb. It was already December 20, and we knew
that we had to be back at our depot on the Drygalski
Glacier not later than February 1 or 2, if there was to be
a reasonable chance of our being picked up by the
Nimrod. That meant that we had to travel at least 480
to 500 miles before we could hope to get to the Magnetic
Pole and back to our depot, and there remained only six
weeks to accomplish this journey.</p>

<p>At the same time we should have to pioneer a road up
to the high plateau, and now that everything was buried
under soft snow it was clear that sledging would be slower
and more difficult than ever. Under the circumstances it
was, perhaps, not to be wondered at that we were not
hopeful of our chance of success.</p>

<p>However, there was nothing to do but to reconnoitre
in a south-westerly direction to see what way was most
practicable for us, and after paddling, unwillingly, in
many shallow pools of water and crossing much pressure-ice
and several crevasses, we at last saw that we should
have to drag our sledge up a steep slope encumbered with
soft deep thawing snow.</p>

<p>We also collected several specimens, including a
solitary coral, and while we were collecting them we could
hear the roar of many mountain torrents descending
the steep granite slopes of the great mountain mass.</p>

<p>Occasionally, too, we heard the boom and crash of an
avalanche descending from the high mountain top, and
such sounds were strange to our ears, accustomed so long
to the almost uninterrupted solitude and silence of the
Antarctic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">- 210 -</span></p>

<p>On the 22nd we were suddenly struck by a furious
blizzard which hindered us until Christmas Eve, but by
ten o'clock on that evening we had succeeded in struggling
on until we were above the uncomfortable zone of thaw,
and everything around us was once more crisp and dry
though cold. We had reached over 1200 ft. above sea
level, and our spirits mounted with the altitude.</p>

<p>On Christmas Day we were delayed at first by a
blizzard, but in spite of this we managed to travel about
four miles and to camp at night over 2000 ft. above sea-level.
Having no other kind of Christmas gift to offer,
Mawson and I presented Mackay with some sennegrass
for his pipe, his tobacco having been exhausted long
before.</p>

<p>The following day saw us again crossing crevasses, and
as some of them were from 20 to 30 ft. wide, it was
fortunate that the snow lids were strong enough to carry
safely both the sledge and ourselves. Mackay suggested
that, for greater security, we should fasten the alpine
rope around Mawson, who was in the lead, and secure
the other end of it to the sledge. The rope was left just
slack enough to admit of the strain of hauling being taken
by the harness rope, and so Mawson had two strings
to his bow in case of being suddenly precipitated into a
crevasse. It was a good system, and we always adopted
it afterwards in crossing heavily crevassed ice.</p>

<p>On the next day we made a small depot of our ski
boots, all our geological specimens, and about one day's
food supply together with a small quantity of oil, and
this we called the Larsen Depot as it was close to one
of the southern spurs of Mount Larsen.</p>

<p>Our eyes were now straining, as we advanced with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">- 211 -</span>
sledge, to see whether any formidable mountains still
barred our path to the plateau, and our thankfulness
was unbounded when at last we realised that apparently
we were going to have a fairly easy ascent of hard nÃ©vÃ© and
snow on to the plateau. On that day we advanced a little
over ten miles, and on December 30 we reached an
altitude of nearly 5000 ft., our breath freezing into lumps
of ice and cementing our Burberry helmets to our beards
and moustaches as in winter time.</p>

<p>New Year's Eve brought with it some disappointment
from Mawson's announcementâ€”after he had taken a fresh
set of magnetic observationsâ€”that he made out the
Magnetic Pole to be further inland than had been
originally estimated. We were still dragging the sledge
on an up grade and on a softer surface than before, and as
we were also obliged to put ourselves on somewhat shorter
rations, in order to form an emergency food-supply in
case our journey proved longer than we anticipated, we
were very much exhausted by night.</p>

<p>On that same evening a skua gull came to visit us, I
am afraid not with any intention of giving us New Year's
greetings, but because he mistook us for seals crawling
inland to die, as is not infrequently the habit of these
animals.</p>

<p>New Year's Day gave us beautifully calm weather, and
to celebrate the beginning of 1909 Mawson provided us
with a grand hoosh and a rich pot of cocoa, which we
enjoyed thoroughly after an exhausting march.</p>

<p>Hunger, indeed, was beginning to beset us, and we
should also have liked more to drink if we could have
afforded it. In fact instead of talking about what we
would like to eat, we began to talk about what we would
drink if we had the chance. Mackay would have liked
to drink a gallon of buttermilk straight off, Mawson wanted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">- 212 -</span>
a big basin of cream, while my choice was several pots of
the best coffee with plenty of hot milk.</p>

<p>We were still climbing on January 3, but on the next
day we were pleased to find that the up grade was becoming
less steep. We had reached an altitude of over 6000 ft.
and found breathing in the cold air distinctly trying.
It was not that definite mountain sickness had attacked
us, but that we felt weaker than usual as the result, doubtless,
of the height combined with the cold.</p>

<p>Still, we were progressing at the rate of about ten miles
a day, and that was enough to make us hopeful in spite
of everything.</p>

<p>On the 6th I left off my crampons and put on a new
pair of finnesko, with the result that I fell heavily over one
of the sastrugi, and slightly straining some muscles on
the inner side of my left leg, just below the knee, I suffered
a considerable amount of pain for the rest of the journey.</p>

<p>Mountain lassitude still continued to attack us and
our hands were often frost-bitten when packing up the
sledge. By the 9th we were completely out of sight of
any mountain ranges, and were toiling up and down
amongst the huge billows of a snow sea.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE MAGNETIC POLE</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Each</span> successive evening saw us some ten miles nearer
to the Magnetic Pole, but by the 11th we had various
inconveniences (to name them mildly) to add to our
difficulties. Mawson had a touch of snow-blindness in
his right eye, and both he and Mackay suffered much
through the skin of their lips peeling off, leaving the raw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">- 213 -</span>
flesh exposed. Mawson, particularly, experienced great
difficulty every morning in getting his mouth to open, as
his lips were firmly glued together.</p>

<p>The compass by this time was very sluggish, in fact
the theodolite compass would scarcely work at all. This
pleased us all a good deal, and at first we all wished more
power to it; and then, recognising our mistake, we
amended the sentiment and cordially wished less power
to it.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 12th, Mawson, after carefully
analysing the results set forth in the advance copy of
the <i>Discovery</i> Expedition Magnetic Report, decided that,
although the matter was not expressly so stated, the Magnetic
Pole instead of moving easterly, as it had done in
the interval between Sabine's observation in 1841 and
the time of the <i>Discovery</i> expedition in 1902, was likely
now to be travelling somewhat to the north-west.</p>

<p>The results of dip readings taken earlier in the journey
also agreed with this decision. It would, therefore, be
necessary to travel farther in that direction than we had
expected, if we were to reach our goal. Most extremely
disquieting news was this for us, as we had come almost
to the end of our provisions, after making allowance for
enough to take us back on short rations to the coast.
Still, in spite of anxiety, our overwhelming weariness
enabled us to get some sleep.</p>

<p>At breakfast on the following morning we fully discussed
our future movements, and Mawson, having
carefully reviewed his observations as to the position of
the Magnetic Pole, decided that we must travel four more
days if we were to reach it, and we resolved to go on
sledging for that time.</p>

<p>On that day we advanced thirteen miles, and on the
next the snow surface over which we were sledging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">- 214 -</span>
sparkled with large reconstructed ice crystals, about
half an inch in width and one sixteenth of an inch in
thickness, which it seemed a sacrilege to break.</p>

<p>On the 15th about twenty minutes before true noon
Mawson took magnetic observations with the dip circle
and found the angle only fifteen minutes off the vertical,
the dip being 89Â° 45'. Naturally we were very much
rejoiced to find that we were close to the Magnetic Pole.
The observations made by Bernacchi, during the two years
of the <i>Discovery</i> expedition sojourn at winter quarters on
Ross Island, showed that the extent of daily swing of
the magnet was sometimes considerable. The compass
at a distance from the Pole pointing in a slightly varying
direction at different times of the day, indicates that the
polar centre executes a daily round of wanderings about
its mean position.</p>

<p>Mawson considered that we were already practically at
the Magnetic Pole; and that if we waited for twenty-four
hours taking constant observations at the spot we had
reached, the Pole would, probably, during that time, come
vertically beneath us. We decided, however, to go on
to the spot where Mawson concluded the approximate
mean position of the Magnetic Pole would lie. That
evening the dip was 89Â° 48'.</p>

<p>From the rapid rate at which the dip had been increasing,
as well as from a comparison of Bernacchi's
magnetic observations, Mawson estimated that we were
about 13 miles distant from the probable mean position
of the South Magnetic Pole. To locate, he said, the
mean position accurately it was possible that a month
of continuous observation would be necessary, but that
the position he indicated was as close as we could
locate it.</p>

<p>Consequently we decided to make a forced march of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">- 215 -</span>
13 miles on the following day to the approximate mean
position of the Pole.</p>

<p>On Saturday, January 16, we were up at 6 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> and
soon started, pulling our sledge for two miles. We then
depoted a lot of our heavy gear and equipment, and
having gone on for another two miles we fixed up the legs
of the dip circle, the compass moving in a horizontal
plane being useless for keeping us on our course.</p>

<p>Two miles farther on we fixed up the legs of the theodolite,
and after another two miles we put up our tent and
had a light lunch.</p>

<p>Afterwards we walked five miles in the direction of the
Magnetic Pole so as to place us in the mean position
calculated for it by Mawson, 72Â° 25â€² South latitude, 155Â°
16â€² East longitude. Mawson placed his camera so as
to focus the whole group, and in the meantime Mackay
and I fixed up the flag-pole.</p>

<p>Then at 3.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> we bared our heads and hoisted the
Union Jack with the words uttered by myself, in conformity
with Lieutenant Shackleton's instructions: "I
hereby take possession of this area now containing the
Magnetic Pole for the British Empire."</p>

<p>At the same time I fired the trigger of the camera by
pulling the string which Mawson had arranged, and
finally we gave three cheers for His Majesty the King.</p>

<p>The temperature at the moment we hoisted the flag was
exactly 0Â° Fahr.</p>

<p>It was an intense satisfaction and relief to all of us to
feel that at last, after so many days of toil and danger, we
had been able to carry out our leader's instructions, and
to fulfil the wish of Sir James Clarke Ross that the South
Magnetic Pole should be actually reached, as he had
already in 1831 reached the North Magnetic Pole.</p>

<p>At the same time we were too utterly weary to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">- 216 -</span>
capable of any great amount of exultation. I am sure
the feeling that was uppermost in all of us was one of
devout and heartfelt thankfulness to the kind Providence
which had so far guided our footsteps in safety to that
goal.</p>

<p>With a fervent "Thank God" we all did a right-about
turn, and marched as quickly as tired limbs would allow
us back towards our little green tent in the wilderness
of snow. Reaching our depot a little before 10 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> that
night, we turned into the sleeping-bag faint and weary,
but happy that a haunting load of possible failure was at
last removed from our minds.</p>

<span class="smaller">RETURNING</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">I called</span> the camp later than usual on the following
morning, and we discussed our chances of catching the
Nimrod if she searched for us along the coast in the
direction of our depot on the Drygalski Glacier.</p>

<p>At the Magnetic Pole we were fully 260 statute miles
distant, as the skua gull flies, from our depot, and as we
had knocked off eleven of these miles on the previous
day we still had 249 miles to cover. If, then we were
to reach the Drygalski depot by February 1, we had only
fifteen days in which to do it, and we should have to
average sixteen and two-third miles a day in order to
reach the coast in the time specified.</p>

<p>This, of course, did not allow for any delay from
blizzards, and we knew from the direction of the sastrugi
during our last few days' march that the prevailing
direction of the blizzards was likely to be exactly in our
teeth. The prospect, therefore, of reaching our depot in
the specified time did not appear to be bright.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">- 218 -</span></p>

<p>On starting, however, on the 17th we had most glorious
weather, and the wind which had helped us towards
the Pole turned round and helped us away from it.
In spite of our late start we sledged 16 miles, and on
the following day, although Mawson's left leg was paining
him, we covered practically the same distance.</p>

<p>The 19th saw us still keeping up the same rate of
progress, but owing to some miscalculation of mine we
discovered that we had no tea for this week, our sixth
week out, unless we took it out of the tea-bag for the
seventh week. Accordingly we halved the tea in the
seventh week bag, and determined to collect our old
tea-bags at each camp as we passed it, and to boil these
bags together with the small pittance of fresh tea.</p>

<p>As we progressed coastwards we soon had quite an
imposing collection of muslin bags with old tea leaves,
and with the thorough boiling they got there was a strong
flavour of muslin added to that of old tea. But nevertheless
we considered that this drink was nectar.</p>

<p>In view of the steady sixteen miles a day that we were
doing Mawson proposed on the 20th that we should return
to nearly full rations, a proposal which was hailed with
delight, for we were becoming very exhausted through
insufficient food.</p>

<p>Up to that date we had been able still to follow our
old sledge tracks, which was a great blessing when the
magnetic needle was of so little use to us. But on the
following days we, lost these tracks, and had a great
deal of pie-crust snow to cross, which made our work
terribly fatiguing.</p>

<p>However, we managed to keep up our sixteen miles
per day, and on January 24 we were cheered by sighting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">- 219 -</span>
Mount Baxter. Towards evening we discussed whether
we were following approximately our old out-going
tracks. Mackay thought we were nearer to the mountain
than before, I thought we were farther to the south-west,
Mawson, who was leading, said that we were pretty
well on our old course. Just then I discovered that we
were actually on our old tracks which showed up plainly
for a short distance, and which were striking evidence of
Mawson's skill as a navigator.</p>

<p>On the next day we encountered a mild blizzard, but
we also managed to sight Mount Nansen just before
we camped, and when we resumed our march we reached
a surface of hard marble-like nÃ©vÃ©, which descended
by short steep slopes.</p>

<p>At first we did not realise that we were about to
descend what we had called the Ice Falls on the outward
journey, and as the sledge occasionally took charge and
rushed down this marble staircase Mawson and I came
some heavy croppers.</p>

<p>On the 27th we were delighted at last to sight Mount
Larsen, and to have reached a point only forty miles
from our Larsen Depot.</p>

<p>The wind was blowing at about 25 miles an hour, and
occasionally, in an extra strong puff, the sledge took
charge. On one of these occasions it suddenly charged
into me from behind, knocked my legs from under me,
and nearly juggernauted me. But I was quickly rescued
from this undignified position by Mawson and Mackay.</p>

<p>At lunch, with a faint hope of softening the heart of
Mackayâ€”who was messman for the weekâ€”I mildly
informed him that it was my birthday. He took the
hint and both at lunch and dinner we all fared, what
we considered, sumptuously.</p>

<p>We advanced twenty miles towards the coast on that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">- 220 -</span>
day, but it had been a most fatiguing journey, and when
we started again we decided that pulling the sledge was
less exhausting than the sailing had proved to be.</p>

<p>Hour by hour we steadily pulled on, Mounts Nansen
and Larsen growing larger and clearer, and we began
to hope that we might be able to reach our depot that
night. But later on Mawson's sprained leg pained him
so much that we had almost decided to camp, when
Mackay's sharp eyes sighted our little blue flag tied to
the ice-axe at our depot. It was, however, past midnight
before we turned into our sleeping-bags.</p>

<p>On the next morningâ€”January 30â€”we were up at
9 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, and after breakfast we collected the material at
our depot, such as ski boots, oil, and geological specimens
and loaded these on to our sledge.</p>

<p>During this day we discussed whether it would be
wiser to descend by the old track up which we had come,
or make down the main Larsen Glacier to the point
where it joined the Drygalski Glacier. Mackay favoured
the former route, while Mawson and I were in favour
of the latter, and, as subsequent events proved, Mackay
was right and we were wrong.</p>

<p>We held on down the main glacier, and the descent
was soon so steep that only with difficulty could we
prevent the sledge from charging down the slope.</p>

<p>On January 31 we took half the load off the sledge, and
started with the remainder to try and work a passage of
the ice-pressure ridges of the combined Drygalski and
Larsen Glaciers on the smoother sea-ice, and eventually
on to the Drygalski Ice Barrier.</p>

<p>While Mawson and Mackay pulled, I steadied the
sledge on the lower side in rounding the steep sidelings,
but in spite of my efforts to keep it on even keel the
sledge frequently capsized. At last we arrived at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">- 221 -</span>
foot of an immense ice-pressure ridge, a romantic-looking
spot with a huge cliff of massive granite rising up on our
left to heights of about 2000 ft., although I admit that at
the time we did not exactly appreciate its romantic beauty.</p>

<p>Mackay reconnoitred, and found that the large pressure
ridge which seemed to bar progress towards our depot
must be crossed. So taking our ice-axes we smoothed
a passage across part of the ridgeâ€”a tough jobâ€”and
then unloaded the sledge and passed each one of our
packages over by hand. Finally we dragged the sledge
up, and hoisted it over and lowered it down safely
on the other side.</p>

<p>Little by little the surface improved after this, until
our progress was once more barred, but on this occasion
by what may be termed an ice donga, apparently an
old channel formed by a river of thaw-water.</p>

<p>We encountered three of them during that afternoon
from a few feet to 50 or 100 ft. broad, and often we had
to take our sledge a long way round to cross them.</p>

<p>Our difficulties were increased by the innumerable
crevasses and steep ice ridges, and once Mackay and I
were in the same crevasse at the same time, he up to his
shoulders and I up to my waist. Fortunately, however,
we were able to save ourselves from falling right through
the lid by throwing out our arms.</p>

<p>While we sledged on through the night, snow began
to fall, and when we camped at 7 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on February 1 we
were all most thoroughly weary.</p>

<span class="smaller">OBSTACLES IN OUR COURSE</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It continued to snow heavily during the day. But
although Mawson's leg pained him a great deal we had
to push on, for we were still sixteen miles, we thought,
from our depot on the Drygalski Glacier, and we had
only two days' food left. So we started to sledge in the
thick, driving snow, but as the work under these conditions
were excessively exhausting, and we were also
unable to keep our proper course while the blizzard lasted,
we camped at 8 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> and were soon sleeping the sleep of
worn and weary wanderers.</p>

<p>On the morning of February 2 we were rejoiced to
find the sun shining, and we resolved to make a desperate
attempt to reach our depot on this day, for we knew that
the <i>Nimrod</i> would be dueâ€”perhaps overdueâ€”by the
night. On looking back we saw that our track of the
day before was about as straight as a corkscrew.</p>

<p>Once more we pulled out over the soft snow, but
although a little refreshed by our good sleep we found
the work extremely trying and toilsome.</p>

<p>We crossed an ice donga, and about four miles out
reached the edge of a second donga. Here we determined
to leave everything but our sledge, tent, sleeping-bag,
cooking apparatus, oil and food, and make a forced
march to the Drygalski depot. Accordingly we camped
and having fixed up our depot, we marked the spot
with a little blue flag tied on to an ice-axe.</p>

<p>The sledge thus lightened was far easier to pull, and
having crossed the donga by a snow-bridge we pulled
steadily onwards, Mawson occasionally sweeping the horizon
with our field-glasses in hopes of sighting our depot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">- 223 -</span></p>

<p>Suddenly he exclaimed that he saw the depot flag
distinctly on its ice mound, about seven miles distant,
but when Mackay and I looked through the glasses
neither of us could see any trace of the flag. Mawson
considered that both of us must be snow-blind, but when
he looked again he at once exclaimed that he could no
longer see the flag. The horizon seemed to be walloping
up and down, just as though it was boiling, evidently the
result of a mirage.</p>

<p>Mawson, however, was so confident that he had seen
the flag, well round on the starboard bow of our sledge
that we altered our course, and after going a little over a
mile, we were rejoiced to hear that he could distinctly see
the depot flag. Full of hope we kept on sledging for
several miles farther, but at midnight when the temperature
had fallen to zero I felt that one of my big toes was
getting frost-bitten. All day my socks had been wet
through, and with the sudden fall of temperature the
water in the socks had turned to ice.</p>

<p>So we halted for me to change my socks and for all of
us to have a midnight meal, and much refreshed we
started off again, thinking that at last we should reach
our depot, or at all events the small inlet a little over a
mile from it. But "the best laid schemes of mice and
men gang aft agley."</p>

<p>There was an ominous white streak ahead of us
with a dark streak just behind it, and soon we saw
that this was due to a ravine in the snow and ice
surface interposing itself between ourselves and our
depot, and shortly afterwards we reached the near
cliff of the ravine.</p>

<p>This ravine was 200 yds. broad, and from 30 to 40 ft.
deep; and it was bounded by a vertical cliff or very
steeply inclined slope on the north-west side, and by an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">- 224 -</span>
overhanging cliff on the south-east side. Inland the
ravine extended as far as the eye could reach.</p>

<p>We determined to try to cross the ravine, at the
bottom of which we were excited to see a number of seals
and Emperor penguins dotted over the ice floor. At
last by means of making fast the Alpine rope to the bow
of the sledge we reached the bottom, and there Mackay
killed two penguins to replenish our exhausted larder.
Meanwhile Mawson was looking out for a spot where we
might swarm up, and as I was feeling much exhausted,
I asked him to take over the leadership of the expedition.</p>

<p>I considered myself justified in taking this step as the
work assigned to us by our leader was accomplished, and
we were within two or three miles of our depot and had
no reason to fear the danger of starvation.</p>

<p>On the other hand, as regards our ultimate personal
safety, our position was rather critical. In the first place,
we were not even certain that the <i>Nimrod</i> had arriven in
Ross Sea; in the second place, assuming that she had, if
was quite possible that she would miss sighting our depot
flags altogether.</p>

<p>In the event of the ship not appearing within a few
days, it would have been necessary to take immediate
action with a view either to winter at the Drygalski
depot or to an attempt to sledge over the steeply
crevassed glacier for over 200 miles to Cape Royds.</p>

<p>Even at the moment, had some immediate strenuous
action been necessary from the <i>Nimrod</i> suddenly appearing,
I thought that it would be best for Mawson, who was
less physically exhausted than I was, to be in charge.</p>

<p>He had, throughout the whole journey, shown excellent
capacity for leadership, and when I spoke to him he at
first demurred, but finally said he would act for a time.</p>

<p>At first we thought that there was one very difficult but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">- 225 -</span>
apparently possible means of ascent up the cliff face;
our efforts, however, in this direction were doomed to
failure, and we were compelled to retrace our steps up
the ravine down which we had previously lowered the
sledge.</p>

<p>This was a tremendous labour, for we could only force
the sledge up a few inches at a time; eventually, however,
we found ourselves on the level plain at the top of the
ravine, but, of course, on the wrong side as far as our
depot was concerned. There we thought it safe to camp,
for we were within three miles of the open sea, and had
the <i>Nimrod</i> sighted our depot flag and stood in to the
coast, we could easily have hurried down to the entrance
of the inlet and made signals to her.</p>

<p>At 7 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> we turned in after toiling for twenty-three
hours, and at about a quarter-past seven, as we learnt
later, the <i>Nimrod</i> must have passed; but owing to a light
wind with snow drift she was unable to sight either our
depot flag or tent.</p>

<p>Having had four hours' rest we packed our sledge and
started along the north bank of the snow gorge, the snow
and ice at the bottom being dotted with basking seals
and moulting Emperor penguins.</p>

<p>At first, in our tired and weak state, we were much
dispirited to find no means of crossing the ravine, but
eventually Mackay, who had gone ahead, shouted that
he had discovered a snow-bridge across it, and when he
had rejoined us we pulled the sledge to the head of the
bridge.</p>

<p>There was a crevasse at both the near and far ends of
the bridge, and stepping over the crevasse at the near
end we launched the sledge with a run down to the centre
of the bridge and then struggled up the steep slope facing
us, Mackay steadying the sledge from falling off the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">- 226 -</span>
narrow causeway, while all of us pulled for all we were
worth.</p>

<p>In another minute or so we were safely across with our
sledge, and thankful to have surmounted the last obstacle
between us and our depot.</p>

<p>As we were all thoroughly exhausted and had reached a
spot from which we could get a good view of the ocean
beyond Drygalski Barrier, we camped at 10.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> on
that evening (February 3) a little over a mile away from
our depot.</p>

<p>During that day we had two of the most satisfying
meals we had eaten for a very long time; a soupy mincemeat
of penguin for lunch, and plenty of seal for dinner.</p>

<p>And after the second meal Mawson and I turned into
the sleeping-bag, leaving Mackay to take the first of our
four-hour watches on the look-out for the <i>Nimrod</i>.
During his watch he walked up to the depot and dug out
our biscuit tin, which had served us as a blubber lamp
and cooker, together with the cut-down paraffin tin which
we had used as a frying-pan, and carried them to the tent.</p>

<p>Then he cooked some penguin meat and regaled himself
with dainty morsels from the savoury dish, and when
he called me at 4 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> I found that he had thoughtfully
put into the frying-pan about two pounds of penguin's
breast for me to toy with during my watch.</p>

<p>During the afternoon of the 4th we discussed our
future plans, and decided that we had better at once
move the tent up to our old depot, where it would be a
conspicuous object from the sea, and where, too, we
could command a more extensive view of the ocean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">- 227 -</span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">- 228 -</span></p>

<p>We also talked about what it would be best to do if the
Nimrod did not appear, and determined that we ought to
tackle the journey to Hut Point, keeping ourselves alive
on the way, as best we might, with seal-meat.</p>

<p>While, however, Mackay thought we ought to start in
a few days, Mawson and I, on the other hand, thought
that we should wait where we were until late in February.
From whatever point of view we looked at it, our lot was
not a happy one.</p>

<p>Dispirited, indeed, by forebodings of much toil and
trouble, we were just preparing to set our weary limbs in
motion to pack up and trek up to the depot, whenâ€”Bang!
went something, seemingly close to the door of our tent.
The sound thrilled us; in another instant the air reverberated
with a big boom, much louder than the first
sound.</p>

<p>Mawson was the first to give tongue, roaring out, "A
gun from the ship!" and dived for the tent door. As the
latter was narrow there was for the moment some congestion
of traffic. I dashed my head forwards, only in
time to receive a few kicks from the departing Mawson.
Just as I was recovering my equilibrium, Mackay made
a wild charge, rode me down, and trampled over my
prostrate body.</p>

<p>When at last I got started, Mawson had got a lead
of a hundred and Mackay of about fifty yards. "Bring
something to wave," Mawson shouted, and rushing back
to the tent I seized Mackay's ruck-sack.</p>

<p>And then as I ran forward again, what a sight met my
gaze! Not a quarter of a mile away was the dear old
Nimrod, steaming straight towards us up the inlet, and
at the sight of the three of us hastening frantically to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">- 229 -</span>
meet the ship, hearty ringing cheers burst forth from all
on board.</p>

<p>It would be hard, indeed, for anyone who has never
been situated as we had been, to realise the sudden
revulsion of our feelings, or to understand how those
cheers stirred every fibre within us. In a moment, as
dramatic as it was heavenly, we seemed to have passed
from death into life.</p>

<p>My first feelings were of intense joy and relief, then of
fervent gratitude to the kind Providence which had so
mercifully led our friends to our deliverance.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, a shout from Mackay called me
back to earth: "Mawson's fallen into a deep crevasseâ€”look
out, it's just in front of you," he called, and I saw
him kneeling near the edge of a small oblong hole in the
nÃ©vÃ©.</p>

<p>"Are you all right, Mawson?" he asked, and from
the depth came up the welcome word, "Yes."</p>

<p>Mackay then told me that Mawson was about twenty
feet down the crevasse, and we decided to try to pull him
up with the sledge harness and hurried back to get it.
Our combined strength, however, was not enough to pull
him up, and as there was a danger of the snow lid at the
surface falling in on Mawson unless it was strengthened
with some planking, we gave up our attempt, I remaining
at the crevasse while Mackay hurried off for help to the
Nimrod.</p>

<p>"Mawson has fallen down a crevasse, and we got to
the Magnetic Pole," Mackay called out, and almost in
less time than it takes to write it officers and sailors
were swarming over the bows of the <i>Nimrod</i> and dropping
on to the ice barrier.</p>

<p>I called to Mawson that help was at hand, and he
replied that he was quite comfortable, for although there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">- 230 -</span>
was seawater at the bottom of the crevasse, he was able
to sustain himself a couple of feet above it on the small
ledge that had stopped his fall.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the rescue party, headed by J. K. Davis,
the first officer of the <i>Nimrod</i>, had arrived, and when the
crevasse had been bridged with a piece of sawn timber,
Davis, with the thoroughness which characterised all his
work, promptly had himself lowered down the crevasse.
And presently Mawson, with only his back slightly bruised
from this fall, and then Davis were safely on the top.</p>

<p>What a joyous grasping of hands and hearty all-round
welcoming followed, and foremost among those old friends
who greeted us was Captain Evans who had commanded
the <i>Koonya</i>, and who was then in command of the <i>Nimrod</i>,
a fact which gave us the greatest satisfaction. Quickly
he assured me of the good health of my wife and family,
and while willing hands packed up our sledge and other
belongings, Captain Evans walked with us to the rope
ladder hanging over the bows of the <i>Nimrod</i>.</p>

<p>Quickly as all this had taken place, Mackay had
already found time to secure a pipe and some tobacco
from one of our crew, and was pulling away to his
heart's content.</p>

<p>After our one hundred and twenty-two days of hard
toil over the sea ice of the coast, and the great snow
desert of the Hinterland, the little ship seemed to us as
luxurious as an ocean liner. Pleasantly the buzz of our
friends' voicesâ€”giving us all the newsâ€”blended itself
with the gentle fizzing of steam from the <i>Nimrod's</i> boiler,
and surely since the days of John Gilpin "were never
folk so glad" as were we three.</p>

<p>Afternoon tea came first and then the joy of reading
the home letters, and finding good news in them. Later
we three had a novel experience, the first real wash for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">- 231 -</span>
over four months, and after diligent scrubbing bits of
our real selves began to show through the covering of
seal-oil and soot.</p>

<p>Of course we over-ate ourselves at dinner, but all the
same we were ready to partake liberally of hot cocoa and
biscuits before we turned in at 10 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span></p>

<p>Under Providence we felt we owed our lives to the
thorough search, sound judgment and fine seamanship
of Captain Evans, and the devotion to duty of his officers
and crew.</p>

<p>My last thought in the twilight that comes between
wakefulness and sleep is expressed in the words of our
favourite record on the gramophone, "So long Thy power
hath blest me, sure it still will lead me on."</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLIV">CHAPTER XLIV<br />
<span class="smaller">THE RETURN TO NEW ZEALAND</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The <i>Nimrod</i>, with Professor David, Mawson and Mackay
aboard, got back to winter quarters on February 11 and
landed Mawson. No news had been heard of the
Southern Party, and the depot party, commanded by
Joyce, was still out. On February 20 it was found that
the depot party had reached Hut Point, and had not
seen Marshall, Adams, Wild or myself. My instructions
had provided that if we had not returned from our
journey toward the South Pole by February 25, a party
was to be landed at Hut Point with a team of dogs, and
on March 1 a search-party was to go south. Murray, who
was in command of the expedition during my absence,
was in no way responsible for the failure of that party to
be landed, and obeyed faithfully my full instructions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">- 232 -</span></p>

<p>All arrangements being completed, most of the members
of the expedition went ashore at Cape Royds to get their
property packed in readiness for departure. The ship
left Cape Royds on the 21st, and was lying under Glacier
Tongue when I arrived at Hut Point with Wild on
February 28, and after I had been landed with the relief
party in order that Adams and Marshall might be brought
in, the ship went to Cape Royds so that the remaining
members of the shore-party and some specimens and
stores might be taken on board.</p>

<p>The <i>Nimrod</i> anchored a short distance from the shore,
and two boats were launched. As everything had to be
lowered by ropes over the cliff into the boats, the work
of embarkation took some time, but by 6 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on March 2
only the men and dogs remained to be taken on board.</p>

<p>A stiff breeze was blowing, and by the time the dogs
had one by one been lowered into the boats, the wind had
freshened to blizzard force, and the sea had begun to run
dangerously. The waves had deeply undercut the ice-cliff,
leaving a projecting shelf.</p>

<p>One boat, in charge of Davis, succeeded in reaching
the ship, but a second boat, heavily laden with men and
dogs, was less fortunate, and before it had gone many
yards from the shore an oar broke.</p>

<p>The <i>Nimrod</i>, owing to the severity of the storm was
forced to slip her moorings and steam from the bay, and
an attempt to float a buoy to the boat was not successful.</p>

<p>Consequently Harbord and his men were in great
danger, for they could not get out of the bay owing to the
force of the sea, and the projecting shelf of ice threatened
disaster if they approached the shore. Flying spray
had encased the men in ice, and their hands were numb
and frozen.</p>

<p>At the end of an hour they managed to make fast to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">- 233 -</span>
line stretched from an anchor a few yards from the cliff,
the men who had remained on shore pulling this line taut.</p>

<p>Their position was still dangerous, but eventually the
men and dogs were all safely hauled up the slippery ice-face
before the boat sank. Hot drinks were soon ready
for them in the hut, and although the temperature was low
and nearly all the bedding had been sent on board, they
were thankful enough to have escaped with their lives.</p>

<p>On the following morning (March 3) the ship came
back to Cape Royds, and having got all the men and
dogs aboard, went back to the Glacier Tongue anchorage
to wait for the relief party.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock that same night Mackintosh was
on deck talking to some other members of the expedition,
when he suddenly became excited and said, "I feel that
Shackleton has arrived at Hut Point." He was very
anxious that the ship should proceed to the Point, but
no one paid much attention to him, and Dunlop advised
him, if he was so sure about it, to go aloft and look for a
signal. Accordingly Mackintosh went aloft, and immediately
seeing our flare at Hut Point the ship left at
once, and by 2 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on March 4 the entire expedition was
safe on board.</p>

<p>If we were to try to complete our work there was no
time to be lost, for the season was far advanced and the
condition of the ice was already a matter of anxiety.
But as I was very eager to undertake exploration with
the ship to the westward towards Adelie Land, with the
idea of mapping the coast-line in that direction, I gave
orders to steam north, and in a very short time we were
under way.</p>

<p>First of all, I wished to round Cape Armitage and pick
up some geological specimens and gear that had been left
at Pram Point, but young ice was forming over the sea,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">- 234 -</span>
and it was evident that we had scarcely an hour to waste
if we were not to spend a second winter in the Antarctic.</p>

<p>Having brought the <i>Nimrod</i> right alongside the pressure
ice at Pram Point, Mackintosh at once landed with a
small party, and as soon as they returned we steamed
north again.</p>

<p>On passing our winter quarters at Cape Royds we all
turned out to give three cheers, and to take a last look
at the place where, in spite of discomforts and hardships,
we had spent so many happy days. We watched the
little hut, which had been our home for a year that must
always live in our memories, fade away in the distance
with feelings almost of sadness, and there were few men
aboard who did not cherish a hope that some day they
might again live strenuous days under the shadow of
mighty Erebus.</p>

<p>I left at the winter quarters on Cape Royds a supply
of stores sufficient to last fifteen men for one year, for
the changes and chances of life in the Antarctic are such
that this supply might be most valuable to some future
expedition. The hut was locked up and the key hung
where it might easily be found, and we re-adjusted the
lashing of our home so that it might withstand the fury
of many blizzards. There our hut stands waiting to be
used, and containing everything necessary to sustain life.</p>

<p>I was anxious to pick up some geological specimens
left on Depot Island, but as the wind had freshened to a
gale, and we were passing through streams of ice, it was
too risky to chance even a short delay, and consequently
I gave instructions that the course should be altered to
due north.</p>

<p>My object was to push between the Balleny Islands
and the mainland, and to make an attempt to follow the
coast line from Cape Nort westward, so as to link up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">- 235 -</span>
with. Adelie Land. No ship had ever succeeded in
penetrating to the westward of Cape North, heavy pack
having been encountered on the occasion of each
attempt. In our attempt we did not manage to do all
that I hoped, but all the same we had the satisfaction of
pushing our little vessel along that coast to longitude
166Â° 14â€² East, latitude 69Â° 47â€² South, a point farther
west than had been reached by any previous expedition.</p>

<p>On the morning of March 8 we saw, beyond Cape North,
a new coast-line extending first to the southwards and
then to the west for a distance of over 45 miles, and
Professor David was of opinion that it was the northern
edge of the polar plateau.</p>

<p>Gladly would we have explored this coast but that
was impossible, for the ice was getting thicker and
thicker, and it was imperative that we should escape to
clear water without delay.</p>

<p>I still, however, hoped that we might skirt the Balleny
Islands and find Wilkes Land, but about midnight on
March 9 I saw that we must go north, and the course was
set in that direction.</p>

<p>As it was we were almost too late, and the situation
looked black indeed when we were held up by the ice,
and the ship was quite unable to move. Fortunately we
found a lane through which progress could be made, and
by the afternoon of the 10th we were in fairly open water.</p>

<p>Our troubles were ended, for we had a good voyage to
New Zealand, and on March 22 we dropped anchor at the
mouth of Lord's river on the south side of Stewart Island.
I did not go to a port because I wished to get the news
of the expedition's work through to London before we
faced the energetic newspaper men.</p>

<p>That day in March was a wonderful one to all of us.
For over a year we had seen nothing but rocks, ice, snow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">- 236 -</span>
and sea. No green growth had gladdened our eyes, no
musical notes of birds had come to our ears. No man
who has not spent a period of his life in those "stark and
sullen solitudes that sentinel the Pole" will understand
fully what trees, and flowers, and running streams mean
to the soul of a man. We landed on the stretch of beach
that separated the sea from the luxuriant growth of the
forest, and scampered about like children in the sheer
joy of being alive.</p>

<p>Early next morning we hove up the anchor, and at
10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> we entered Half Moon Bay. There I went ashore,
and having despatched my cablegrams from the little
office I went on board again and ordered the course to
be set for Lyttelton, the port from which we had sailed
on the first day of the previous year, and we arrived
there on March 25 late in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The people of New Zealand would have welcomed us,
I think, whatever had been the result of our efforts, for
since the early days of the <i>Discovery</i> expedition their
keen interest in Antarctic exploration has never faltered,
and their attitude towards us was always that of warm
personal friendship.</p>

<p>But the news of the measure of success we had achieved
had been published in London and flashed back to the
southern countries, and we were met out in the harbour
and on the wharves by cheering crowds. Enthusiastic
friends boarded the <i>Nimrod</i> almost as soon as she entered
the heads, and when our gallant little vessel came alongside
the quay the crowd on deck became so great that
movement was almost impossible.</p>

<p>Then I was handed great bundles of letters and cablegrams.
The loved one at home were well, the world was
pleased with our work, and it seemed as though nothing
but joy and happiness could ever enter life again.</p>

<span class="smaller">PENGUINS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="tdc">(<i>Some Notes by James Murray, Biologist to the
Expedition</i>)</p>


<p>Though so much has been written about them, penguins
always excite fresh interest in every one who sees them
for the first time.</p>

<p>There is endless interest in watching them; the
dignified Emperor, dignified in spite of his clumsy waddle,
going along with his wife (or wives) by his side, the very
picture of a successful, self-satisfied, unsuspicious countryman,
and gravely bowing like a Chinaman before a
yelping dog, and also the little undignified matter-of-fact
Adelie, minding his own business in a most praiseworthy
manner. Often they behave with apparent stupidity,
but sometimes they show a good deal of intelligence.
Their resemblance to human beings is always noticed,
partly because they walk erect, but they also have many
other human traits. They are the civilised nations of the
Antarctic regions, and their civilisation, if much simpler
than ours, is in some respects higher and more worthy of
the name.</p>

<p>But there is also a good deal of human nature in them.
As in the human race, their gathering in colonies does
not show any true social instinct; each penguin is in the
rookery for his own ends, there is no thought of the
general good. You might exterminate an Adelie rookery
with the exception of one bird, and he would not mind
so long as you left him alone.</p>

<p>Some suggestion of unselfishness does appear in the
nesting habits of the Adelie, and like men the Adelies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">- 239 -</span>
have the unpleasant habit of stealing and the pleasant
one of not making eating the prime business in life.
Both Emperors and Adelies, when nesting is off their
minds, show a legitimate curiosity, and having got into
good condition they leave the sea and go off in parties
for weeks, apparently to see the country.</p>

<p>We saw the Emperor penguins only as a summer
visitor, when having finished nesting and having fed up
and become glossy and beautiful, they came up out of
the sea, apparently to have a good time before moulting.
While the Adelies were nesting the Emperors came in
numbers to inspect the camp, the two kinds usually
paying no attention to each other unless an Adelie
thought an Emperor came too close to her nest, when an
odd unequal quarrel followed. Little impudence, pecking
and scolding, and being more than able to hold her own
with the tongue, but knowing the value of discretion
whenever the Emperor raised his flipper.</p>

<p>The Emperors were very inquisitive and would come a
long way to see a motor-car or a man, and when out on
these excursions the leader kept his party together by a
long shrill squawk. Distant parties saluted in this way.</p>

<p>The first party to arrive inspected the boat, and then
crossed the lake to the camp, but when they discovered
the dogs all other interests were swallowed up. After
the discovery crowds of Emperors came every day, and
from the manner in which they went straight to the
kennels one was tempted to believe that the fame of the
dogs had been noised abroad.</p>

<p>As regards meetings, Emperors were very ceremonious,
whether meeting other Emperors, men, or dogs. They
came up to a party of strangers in a straggling procession,
some big aldermanic fellow leading. At a respectful
distance they halted, and the old male waddled close up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">- 240 -</span>
and bowed gravely until his head almost touched his
breast. With his head still bowed he made a long speech
in a muttering manner, and having finished his speech he
still kept his head bowed for a few seconds for politeness
sake, and then raising it he described with his bill as large
a circle as the joints of his neck would allow, and finally
looked into our faces to see if we understood. If we had
not, as usually was the case, he tried again.</p>

<p>He was infinitely patient with our stupidity, but his
followers were not so patient with him, and presently
they would become sure that he was making a mess of it.
Then another male would waddle forward and elbow the
first Emperor aside as if to say, "I'll show you how it
ought to be done," and went again through the whole
business.</p>

<p>Their most solemn ceremonies were used towards the
dogs, and three old fellows were seen calmly bowing and
speaking at the same time to a dog, which was yelping
and straining at its chain in the desire to get at them.</p>

<p>Left to themselves the Emperor penguins seemed
perfectly peaceable, but if they did use their flippers
they could strike forward or backward with equal ease.</p>

<p>They seemed to regard men as penguins like themselves,
but if a man walked too fast among them or touched
them they were frightened and ran away, only fighting
when closely pressed. As one slowly retreated, fighting,
he had a ludicrous resemblance to a small boy being
bullied by a big one, his flipper being raised in defence
towards his foe as he made quick blows at the bully.
It was well to keep clear of that flipper, for it was very
powerful and might easily break an arm.</p>

<p>Many of the stupid acts of both kinds of penguins are
doubtless to be traced to their very defective sight in air,
and to this defect one must ascribe the fact that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">- 241 -</span>
when they fought the blows from their bills always fell
short.</p>

<p>The Emperor can hardly be said to migrate, but
nevertheless he travels a good deal, and the meaning of
some of his journeys remain a mystery.</p>

<p>On journeys they often travel many miles walking
erect, when they get along at a very slow shuffle, making
only a few inches at each step. In walking thus they
keep their balance by means of their tails, which forms a
tripod with the legs. When, however, they are on a
suitable snow surface, they progressed rapidly by tobogganing,
a very graceful motion, when they made
sledges of their breasts and propelled themselves by their
powerful legs, balancing, and perhaps increasing their
speed, by means of their wings.</p>

<p>Eight of them visited the car one day, sledging swiftly
towards us, and one obstinate old fellow, who was not
going to be hurried away by anybody, had to see the car
bearing down upon him before he was persuaded to
hustle.</p>

<p>The Adelie is always comical. He pops out of the
water with startling suddenness, like a jack-in-the-box,
alights on his feet, shakes his tail, and toddles off about
his business. He always knows where he wants to go
and what he wants to do, and it is difficult to turn him
aside from his purpose.</p>

<p>In the water the Adelie penguins move rapidly and
circle in the same way as a porpoise or dolphin, for which
they are easily mistaken at a little distance. On level
ice or snow they can get along about as fast as a man at a
smart walk, but they find even a small crack a serious
obstruction, and pause and measure with the eye one
of a few inches before very cautiously hopping over it.
They flop down and toboggan over any opening more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">- 242 -</span>
than a few inches wide. Very rarely they swim in the
water like ducks, and on these infrequent occasions their
necks are below the surface and their heads are just
showing.</p>

<p>The Adelie shows true courage in the breeding-season,
for after he has learned to fear man he remains to defend
the nest against any odds. When walking among the
nests one is assailed on all sides by powerful bills, and for
protection we wore long felt boots reaching well above
the knee. Some of the clever ones, however, realised
that they were wasting their efforts on the boots, and
coming up behind would seize the skin above the boot
and hang on tight, beating with their wings.</p>

<p>Some birds became so greatly interested in the camp
that they wanted to nest there. One bird (we believe
it was always the same one) could not be kept away and
used to come every day, until at last he was carried away
by Brocklehurst, a wildly struggling, unconquerable
being.</p>

<p>The old birds enjoy play, while the young ones are
solely engaged in satisfying the enormous appetites they
have when growing. While the <i>Nimrod</i> was frozen in
the pack some dozens of them disported themselves in a
sea-pool alongside. They swam together in the duck
fashion, then at a squawk from one they all dived and
came up at the other side of the pool.</p>

<p>Early in October they began to arrive at the rookery,
singly or in pairs. The first to come were the males, and
they at once began to scrape up the frozen ground to
make hollows for nests, and to collect stones for the walls
with which they surrounded them.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">- 244 -</span></p>

<p>When the rookery is pretty well filled, and the nest-building
is in full swing, the birds have a busy and
anxious time. To get enough suitable small stones is a
matter of difficulty, and may involve long journeys for
each single stone, so the temptation is too strong for
some of the birds, and they become habitual thieves.
The bearing of the thief, however, clearly shows that he
knows that he is doing wrong, for very different is his
furtive look, even after he is quite out of danger of
pursuit, from the expression of the honest penguin
coming home with a hard-earned stone.</p>

<p>A thief, sitting on its own nest, was stealing from an
adjacent nest, whose honest owner was also at home but
looking unsuspectingly in another direction. Casually
the latter turned his head and caught the thief in the very
act, whereupon the culprit dropped the stone and pretended
to be busy picking up an infinitesimal crumb from
the neutral ground. Undoubtedly then the penguin has
a conscience, at least a human conscience, that is the fear
of being found out.</p>

<p>This stone-gathering is a very strong part of the
nesting instinct, and even if at a late stage the birds lost
their eggs or their young, they began again, in a half-hearted
way, to heap up stones. Unmated birds occupied
the fringe of the rookery, and amused themselves piling
and stealing till the chicks began to hatch out.</p>

<p>After the two eggs were laid the malesâ€”who always
seemed to be in the majorityâ€”used to do most of the
work, and judging from certain signs it would seem that
some of the birds never left their nests to feed during
the whole period of incubation. Many birds lost their
mates through the occasional breaking loose of a dog,
and these birds could not leave their nests.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE ADELIES AND THEIR CHICKS</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> rookery is most interesting after the chicks arrive.
The young chicks are silvery or stately grey, with darker
heads, which are heavy for the first day or so and hang
down helplessly. After hatching the parents take equal
share in tending the chicks, whatever they may have
done before. For some weeks the nest cannot be left
untended, or the chicks would perish of cold or fall victims
to the skuas.</p>

<p>When the young ones can hold up their heads the
feeding begins, and at first the parent tries to induce its
offspring to feed by tickling its bill and throat. After
the chick has once learned to feed the parents are taxed
by the clamouring for more food.</p>

<p>For some weeks after hatching life in the rookery is
smooth enough, for one parent is always on the nest and
the young birds do not wander. Then the trouble begins,
for the young begin to move about, and if anything
disturbs the colony they suffer from panic.</p>

<p>The chicks knowing neither nest nor parent cannot
return home, so they meet the case by adopting parents,
and although some of the old ones resent this method
most of the chicks succeed in getting into nests. The old
bird may have chicks already, but as she does not know
which are her own she cannot drive the intruders away,
and sometimes we saw a sorely puzzled parent trying to
cover four gigantic chicks.</p>

<p>The times comes when both parents must be absent
together to get food for the growing chicks, and then the
social order of the rookery gives way to chaos. But the
social condition which is evolved out of the chaos is one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">- 246 -</span>
the most remarkable in nature, and both serves its purpose
and saves the race. The parents returning with food
come back from the sea with the intention of finding
their nests and feeding their own young ones, but the
young one assumes that the first old one that comes
within reach is its parent, and, perhaps, it really thinks
so, as the parents are all alike.</p>

<p>An old bird, coming up full of shrimps, is met by
clamorous youngsters before it has time to begin the
search for its nest. The chicks order the parent to stand
and deliver, and the latter scolds and runs off. But the
chicks are both wheedling and imperative, and soon there
begins one of those parent hunts which were so familiar
at the end of the season.</p>

<p>The result, however, is never in doubt. At intervals
the old one is weak enough to stop and expostulate, but
there is no indecision on the part of the young ones,
which in the most matter-of-fact and persistent manner
hunt the old one down.</p>

<p>Sometimes these chases last for miles, but in the end
the old one stops, and still spluttering and protesting
delivers up.</p>

<p>One would think that under these circumstances the
weaker chicks would go to the wall, but as far as could
be seen there were no ill-nourished young ones. Perhaps
the hunt takes so long that all get a chance.</p>

<p>A few days after the eggs began to hatch there was a
severe blizzard, which lasted for several days. Where
the snow had drifted deepest, nests and birds were covered
out of sight, and the indication of the whereabouts of a
bird was a little funnel in the snow, at the bottom of
which an anxious eye could be seen. On a moderate
estimate about half the young perished in this blizzard.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">- 248 -</span></p>

<p>The old Adelies do not mind the cold, their thick
blubber and dense fur protecting them sufficiently, and
in a blizzard they will lie still and let the snow cover
them. Once after a blizzard I went to the rookery and
could see no penguins, but suddenly, at some noise,
they sprung out of the snow, and I was surrounded by
them.</p>

<p>While the Adelie appears to be entirely moral in his
domestic arrangements, his stupidity (or his short-sightedness,
which causes him to seem stupid) gives rise
to many complications. All the birds go to their nests
without hesitating when they come from the sea by the
familiar route, but if taken from their nests to another
part of the rookery, some easily find their way back but
others are quite lost. They are most puzzled when
moved only a little way from home, and they will fight
to keep another bird's nest while their own is only a
couple of feet away.</p>

<p>There is no doubt, however, that the presence of our
camp upset their social arrangements, and probably
when undisturbed there would be no confusion and
complications.</p>

<p>As it was, a mere walk among the nests caused innumerable
entanglements, for one bird would leave its
nest in fright, and flop down a yard away beside a nest
already occupied, or on a nest left exposed by another
frightened bird.</p>

<p>But in all such cases, even when a bird got established
on the wrong nest, things were always put straight afterwards.
When they calmed down they became uneasy,
probably observing the landmarks more critically, and
they would even leave a nest with chicks for their own
empty nest.</p>

<p>We tried some experiments on the penguins in order
to trace the working of their minds. If one of us stood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">- 249 -</span>
between a bird and its nest so as to prevent it from
approaching, the bird would make many furious attempts
to reach home. After a time, however, it would appear
to meditate, and then walk off rather disconsolately,
and having made a tour of the colony would approach
the nest from the other side. Apparently it was greatly
astonished to find that the intruder was still there, and
this curious trait was often seen.</p>

<p>It is like the ostrich burying its head in the sand and
imagining itself safe, or like a man refusing to believe his
own eyes. It appears to think that if it comes to the
nest from the other side the horrible vision will have
disappeared.</p>

<p>A lost chick was never sought for, indeed there would
have been no use in such a proceeding for it could not be
recognised. On account of this peculiarity we were able
to make many readjustments of the family arrangements.
When the blizzard destroyed so many chicks
we distributed the young from nests where there were
two to nests where there were none, and these chicks
were usually adopted with eagerness.</p>

<p>When both birds are at a nest that is disturbed, or
when the mate comes up from feeding to relieve guard,
there is an interchange of civilities in the form of a loud
squawking in unison, accompanied by a curious movement.
The birds' necks are crossed, and at each squawk
they are changed from side to side, first right then left.
We were for some time mistaken in thinking that this
harsh clamour was quarrelling.</p>

<p>A bird returning from the sea came to the wrong nest
and tried to converse with the occupant, who would
have nothing to do with him. The occupant knew that
her mate had just gone off for the day, and would not
be such a fool as to return too early, so she sat still,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">- 250 -</span>
indifferent to the squawking of the other. Presently a
look of distress came into the visitor's face as he failed
to get a response, but he was very slow to realise that he
had made a mistake.</p>

<p>The Adelies are not demonstrative of their affections,
and it is difficult to discover if they have any beyond
the instinctive affection for the young. One curious
incident, however, did occur, which possibly, was in
opposition to what we expected after a long study of the
penguins' habits.</p>

<p>An injured bird which we had tried to nurse died, and
shortly afterwards a live penguin was found standing by
it. We moved the dead bird to a distance, and after a
time found the other again standing beside it. It was
the general opinion that this was the dead bird's mate
which had found it out. From any point of view the
occurrence was puzzling, but I find it less difficult to
believe that the bird had found its dead mate than that
it took an interest in a dead stranger, because there were
always plenty of dead birds about a rookery, and the
living went about entirely indifferent to them.</p>

<p>Instances of real kindness were sometimes noticed;
for instance, our passage through the rookery frightened
away the parent of a very young chick, and a bird passing
a few yards away noticed this and came over to the chick.
The bird cocked his head on one side as if saying:
"Hullo! this little beggar's deserted; must do something
for him." Then he tickled its bill, but the chick
was too frightened to feed. After coaxing it in this way
the bird turned away and put some food on the ground,
and then lifting a little in his bill he put some on each
side of the chick's bill. This was not an isolated case,
but was observed on several occasions, the helper always
running off when the rightful parent returned.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">- 252 -</span></p>

<p>One incident seemed to reveal true social instinct.
From a small colony all the eggs except one were taken
to see if the birds would lay again. As it happened they
did not, and, after the birds had sat on their empty
nests for some time, they disappeared. But when the
time came for the solitary egg to hatch quite half the
nests were re-occupied, and the birds took their share in
defending the one chick.</p>

<p>When the young birds have shed most of their down
they cease from hunting the old ones for food, and congregating
at the edge of the sea appear to be waiting for
something. When the right time, which they seem to
know perfectly, comes, they dive into the sea, sometimes
in small parties, sometimes singly, disappear and may
be seen popping up far out to sea. They dive and come
up very awkwardly, but swim well.</p>

<p>It is marvellous how fully instinct makes these birds
independent, for the parents do not take them to the
water and teach them to swim, indeed the old ones stay
behind to moult. Though the chicks have spent their
lives on land and only know that food is something found
in an old bird's throat, when the time comes they leave
the land and plunge boldly into the sea, untaught, to
get their living by straining crustacea out of the water
in the same way as a whale does.</p>

<p>Some of our party did report that they saw penguins
teaching the young to swim, but if this ever happens
it is not general.</p>

<p>Like the Emperor, the Adelie is fond of travelling
when free from family cares. The great blizzard unfortunately
left hundreds of old birds with no chicks to
guard and feed, and they began to explore the country
in bands. The round of the lakes was a favourite trip,
and tracks also led to the summits of some of the hills,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">- 253 -</span>
although the short-sighted Adelie could hardly have
gone there for the view.</p>

<p>There was no general trek southwards, such as the
Emperors made, but the Southern Party found tracks
of two Adelies at a distance of some 80 miles from the
sea.</p>

<p>While chaos reigned in the rookery I found two Adelie
chicks exhausted and covered with mire, and I took
them to the hut and bestowed upon them the dignified
names of Nebuchadnezzar and Nicodemus. They were
placed in a large cage in the porch, and fed by hand
with sardines and fish-cakes. They did not, however,
like our way of feeding them, and it was necessary to force
the food so far down their throats that they were compelled
to swallow it.</p>

<p>In a few days they became quite tame and recognised
those who fed them. Familiar only with our peculiar
method of feeding them, one of them used to show when
he was hungry by taking my finger into his bill.</p>

<p>We shortened their names to Nebby and Nicky and
they answered to them, but they answered with equal
readiness to the common name of Bill. When sounds
from the rookery reached them they would become
greatly excited, and tried so desperately to get through
the netting of their cage that we used to take them out
for a walk. Then they would make no attempt to go to
the rookery and were rather frightened.</p>

<p>Nebuchadnezzar was a very friendly little fellow, and
would follow me about outside and come running when
called. But their feeding was unnatural, and for this
reason, doubtless, both of them died after a few weeks.</p>

<p>A single ringed penguin appeared at Cape Royds at
the end of the breeding season, just as the Adelies were
beginning to moult. It is about the same size as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">- 254 -</span>
Adelie but is more agile, and at a little distance, among
a crowd of old Adelies, he looked not unlike a young
Adelie with the white throat. But when I picked him up
by the legs to investigate, he surprised me by curling
round and biting me on the handâ€”a feat that the Adelie
could not performâ€”and a closer examination showed
me what he was. Never before had a ringed penguin been
seen in this part of the Antarctic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first seals which we met on this expedition were
seen on our voyage from New Zealand before we entered
the actual line of bergs. I did not see them myself, but
from descriptions I gathered that one was a crabeater,
and the other a Weddell seal. Later on, of course, seals
were to be seen in numbers, and one of the reasons why
I selected Cape Royds for our winter quarters was because
I saw plenty of them lying on the bay ice, and consequently
we should not be likely to suffer from a lack
of fresh meat.</p>

<p>On the return from the Magnetic Pole, Mackay found
two young seals, which behaved in a most unusual
manner, for instead of waiting without moving, as did
most of the Weddell seals, they scuttled away actively
and quickly.</p>

<p>Later on he discovered that these two seals belonged
to the comparatively rare variety known as Ross seal.</p>

<p>On our voyage back to New Zealand I sent a party to
the seal rookery near Pram Point to see if they could find
a peculiar seal that we had noticed on the previous night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">- 255 -</span></p>

<p>This seal was either a new species or the female of the
Ross seal. It was a small animal, about four feet six
inches long, with a broad white band from its throat right
down to its tail on the underside. The search, however,
proved a fruitless one.</p>

<p>On our voyage out albatrosses were numerous, especially
the sooty species, the death of which, on Shelvoke's
voyage, inspired Coleridge's memorable poem. I noticed
one, flying low between the two ships, strike its wings
against the wire tow-line, which had suddenly emerged
from the waves owing to the lift of the <i>Koonya's</i> stern
upon a sea.</p>

<p>Skua gulls were bathing and flying about in hundreds
when we first arrived at Cape Royds. But the most
remarkable bird seen on our expedition was discovered
by Marshall and Adams on our southern journey, remarkable
because it was seen in latitude 83Â° 40â€² South.</p>

<p>This bird was brown in colour with a white line under
each wing, and it flew just over their heads and disappeared
to the south.</p>

<p>They were sure that it was not a skua gull, which was
the only bird I could think would venture so far south.
Indeed, on my previous southern trip, when in latitude
80Â° 30â€² South, a skua gull had arrived shortly after we
had killed a dog.</p>

<p>As regards bears I have nothing to say except that
there are none down south.</p>

Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
